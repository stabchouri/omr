'''
Defines a function convert() that takes a SMILES string and returns
a new SMILES string where some groups have been converted to their
shorthand form. The new strings are **not** valid SMILES strings,
but are appropriate for pasting/drawing in ChemDraw.

The conversions are made stochastically with very crude 
probabilities that seemed appropriate based on how common certain
abbreviations are. These are all definede in substitutions.py

There needs to be some work done on alkyl side chains to prevent
longer chains from being written as CCCCC[Et], since that isn't
ever done in practice. Maybe fixable with recursive SMARTS.
