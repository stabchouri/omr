ABSTRACT: Oligonucleotides with parallel or antiparallel strand orienta-
tion incorporating 2′-ﬂuorinated 2′-deoxyribonucleosides with canonical
nucleobases or 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocytidine (FiCd, 1c) and 2′-deoxy-2′-
ﬂuoroisoguanosine (FiGd, 3c) were synthesized. To this end, the nucleosides
1c and 3c as well as the phosphoramidite building blocks 19 and 23 were
prepared and employed in solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Unexpect-
edly, FiCd is not stable during oligonucleotide deprotection (55 °C, aq NH3)
and was converted to a cyclonucleoside (14). Side product formation was
circumvented when oligonucleotides were deprotected under mild conditions
(aq ammonia−EtOH, rt). Oligonucleotides containing 2′-ﬂuoro substituents
(FiCd, FiGd and ﬂuorinated canonical 2′-deoxyribonucleosides) stabilize
double-stranded DNA, RNA, and DNA−RNA hybrids with antiparallel
strand orientation. Unexpected strong stability changes are observed for
oligonucleotide duplexes with parallel chains. While ﬂuorinated oligonucleo-
tides form moderately stable parallel stranded duplexes with complementary DNA, they do not form stable hybrids with RNA.
Furthermore, oligoribonucleotide duplexes with parallel strand orientation are extremely unstable. It is anticipated that nucleic
acids with parallel chains might be too rigid to accept sugar residues in the N-conformation as observed for ribonucleosides or 2′-
deoxy-2′-ﬂuororibonucleosides. These observations might explain why nature has evolved the principle of antiparallel chain
orientation and has not used the parallel chain alignment.

■ INTRODUCTION

DNA with parallel strand (ps) orientation can be constructed
from any single-stranded DNA of natural or artiﬁcial origin
when the complementary strand consists of the four nucleo-
sides 2′-deoxyisocytidine (iCd, 1a) or its 5-methyl derivative
(MeiCd, 2a), 2′-deoxyisoguanosine (iGd, 3a), dA, and dT
(Figure 1).1,2 Parallel-stranded DNA is remarkably stable but
shows a lower stability than DNA with antiparallel strand (aps)
orientation.3 From that,
the lower
stability of ps DNA results from the low strength of the reverse
Watson−Crick dA−dT pair (Donohue pair). Incorporation of
−dG pairs in ps DNA can compensate the loss
iGd
of stability.1 Furthermore, nucleoside shape mimics with a
pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine or a pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine skel-
eton replacing the nucleobases of dA or dT and iGd or iCd have
been shown to be well accommodated in ps DNA and add
additional stability to the parallel helix structure.4

Previously, the beneﬁcial inﬂuence of ﬂuorine substituents to
antiviral nucleosides and to antisense oligonucleotides with
antiparallel strand orientation was demonstrated.5,6 The high

resistant

ﬂuorine−carbon bond stability (109 kcal/mol)7 makes ﬂuorine
substituents rather
to metabolic transformations.
Furthermore, the ﬂuorine atom introduces lipophilicity into
the molecule.8 The target site of the ﬂuoro modiﬁcation in
antisense oligonucleotides is usually the 2′-position of the sugar
moiety with the ﬂuorine substituent in the “ribo” (down)
conﬁguration as shown for 1b−3b and 1c−3c (Figure 1). The
hydrophobic, but still polar, ﬂuorine substituent has approx-
imately the same atomic radius as hydrogen and is well
accommodated in DNA and DNA−RNA hybrids.9 Never-
theless, the van der Waals radius of ﬂuorine is larger (1.47 Å)
than that of hydrogen (1.20 Å) but similar to that of oxygen
(1.52 Å).10 Apart

electronegativity of a substituent and has therefore a great
impact on the sugar conformation. The replacement of the 2′-
OH group of the ribose moiety by a ﬂuorine atom leads to a
preferred 3′-endo (N) conformation of the sugar residue, which

from that, ﬂuorine has

is the conformation of RNA duplexes.11 In the antisense
approach, entirely 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoro-modiﬁed oligonucleoti-
des, which adopt an A conformation, show a high binding
aﬃnity to their RNA target.9a It was assumed that the increased
pairing aﬃnity of 2′-F-RNA compared to RNA results from a
positive enthalpic eﬀect going back to strengthening of H-
bonding, stacking interactions, and a higher rigidity of the
duplex backbone induced by the electron-withdrawing eﬀect of
ﬂuorine in the 2′-position.6b Another interesting property of
ﬂuorine is the ease of detection by 19F NMR spectroscopy and
the use of the radiolabeled 18F isotope as tracer in in PET
imaging.12

In this study, the concept of parallel strand orientation which
was already realized by using isocytosine nucleosides (1a,b,
2a,b)13 and isoguanine nucleosides (3a,b)14 (Figure 1) is now
combined with the unique properties of 2′-ﬂuoro substitution,
such as enhanced binding aﬃnity and nuclease resistance. To
construct parallel-stranded DNA with 2′-ﬂuoro substituents,
building blocks (phosphoramidites) of 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocy-
tidine (FiCd, 1c) and 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisoguanosine (FiGd, 3c)
were prepared and applied to automatized solid-phase
oligonucleotide synthesis. To this end, the precursor nucleo-
sides 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocytidine and 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroiso-
guanosine were synthesized. The base-pairing properties of FiCd
and FiGd in DNA duplexes with parallel chain orientation are
studied and compared with those in DNA duplexes with
antiparallel chains. Hybridization experiments are performed

the eﬀect of the 2′-ﬂuorine substituent is related to non-
ﬂuorinated oligonucleotides.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1. Synthesis of 2′-Deoxy-2′-ﬂuororibonucleosides. 2′-
Deoxy-2′-ﬂuororibonucleosides with canonical nucleobases are
known for several decades (FAd,15 FUd,16 FGd
17 and FCd;18 for
structures see Table 1). Corresponding phosphoramidites were
employed in oligonucleotide synthesis (for structures see
Figure S1, Supporting Information).9a,19 Several reviews on
this matter appeared in the literature.20 To the best of our
knowledge, synthetic routes to access 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocy-
tidine (1c) and 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisoguanosine (3c) have not
been reported before.
2′-Deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocytidine (1c). The synthesis of 2′-
deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocytidine (1c) uses 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuorouridine
(4) as starting material (Scheme 1). This route employs similar

introduced in the 5′-position (→ 9), and an acetyl group was
used for 3′-protection to acquire compound 10.9a,22b,c Then,
the 5′-O-DMT group was
removed and the resulting
compound 1122b,c was 5′-O-tosylated using p-toluenesulfonyl
chloride to give 12 (88% yield). Treatment of 12 with DBU in
reﬂuxing CH3CN furnished the 3′-O-acetylated 2,5′-anhydro
nucleoside 13 (79%), which after treatment with K2CO3 in
MeOH gave 8 (86%) (Scheme 2). Finally, treatment of 8 with
saturated NH3/MeOH aﬀorded nucleoside 1c.

In summary, the ﬁrst route gives the target nucleoside 1c in
an overall yield of 8% over three steps, while the second route
leads to an improved overall yield of 25% over seven steps.
Therefore,
if time matters, the ﬁrst route is the method of
choice to access 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocytidine (1c).
As discussed in section 4, it was found that oligonucleotides
with 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocytidine residues are rather labile
under standard oligonucleotide deprotection conditions. To
verify this ﬁnding, nucleoside 1c was treated with concentrated
aqueous NH3 at 55 °C for 16 h (standard oligonucleotide
deprotection conditions). HPLC analysis of
the reaction
mixture indicated the formation of two side products (14:
major and 15: minor), while almost no starting material was left
(Figure 2a and Figure S2, Supporting Information). Hence, it
was proven that side product formation could be minimized
when mild oligonucleotide deprotection conditions were
treatment of 1c in a mixture of EtOH/
chosen. Indeed,
concentrated aqueous NH3 (1:3) at room temperature kept the
main amount of 1c intact with only a small amount of
formation of the faster migrating side product 14 (Figure 2b).
As deprotection at room temperature is suﬃcient to remove all
base protecting groups from oligonucleotides (data not shown),
we were conﬁdent that pure oligonucleotides containing 2′-

reaction steps as described for 2′-deoxyisocytidine.13d,21 To this
end, nucleoside 4 was tosylated with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride
in pyridine. Diﬀerent to the reaction of 2′-deoxyuridine which
yields the 5′-O-tosylated compound as major product,21
tosylation of 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuorouridine (4) furnished a mixture
of the 5′-O-tosylated compound 7 (30%) together with the 3′-
O-derivative 6 (11%) and the 3′,5′-bis-O-tosylated nucleoside 5
(26%). The reaction products were separated by ﬂash column
chromatography and characterized by NMR spectra and ESI-
TOF mass spectra. Modiﬁed reaction conditions did not lead to
an improved yield of nucleoside 7. Next, the 5′-O-tosylated 7
was treated with DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) in
dry CH3CN under
for 30 min (TLC
monitoring) aﬀording 8 in 46% yield. Finally, treatment of
the 2,5′-anhydro nucleoside 8 with saturated NH3/MeOH at
room temperature overnight furnished 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocy-
tidine (1c) in 58% yield (Scheme 1;
for details, see the
Experimental Section).

unsatisfactory, an alternative route was developed (Scheme

ropurine nucleoside 16, whose chemical and enzymatic
synthesis has been reported,25 was used as starting material
for the preparation of 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisoguanosine (3c).
Deamination of 16 using NaNO2 in AcOH gave compound 3c

Then, the structure of the side products was evaluated. To
this end, the 2′-ﬂuoro nucleoside 1c was fully converted to the
side products 14 and 15 at 55 °C in concentrated aqueous
ammonia (preparative scale experiment) (Scheme 3). On the

were chosen for its preparation. Nucleoside 3c is stable under
moderate alkaline or acidic conditions and shows strong
gelation properties in water. The same is observed for the 2′-
ﬂuorinated 2,6-diaminopurine nucleoside 16 as well as for 2′-
deoxyisoguanosine (3a). A detailed investigation of this matter
will be described elsewhere.
2. Building Block Synthesis. Having both 2′-ﬂuoro-
modiﬁed nucleosides in hand, building blocks for solid-phase
oligonucleotide synthesis were prepared. To this end, the 2-
amino group of 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocytidine 1c was protected
at the nucleobase with a (dimethylamino)methylidene residue
to give 17 in 77% yield. 4,4′-Dimethoxytritylation of the 5′-OH
group aﬀorded 18 (76%) and phosphitylation furnished 19

of the faster migrating material was assigned to cyclonucleoside
14 and the ﬂuorescent slower migrating compound to base 15
(Figure 2c and Figure S2, Supporting Information).23 Cyclo-
nucleoside formation as occurring on nucleoside 1c is possible
because of the spatial proximity of the nucleobase amino group
and the 2′-ﬂuorinated sugar carbon. This steric arrangement

of the molecule to compound 15 has already been reported.23

Next, 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisoguanosine 3c was converted to
the phosphoramidite 23. Diﬀerent to 2′-deoxyguanosine but
similar to 2′-deoxyisoguanosine both, the amino group and the
oxo group of
the nucleobase have to be protected. All
protecting groups should be removed under mild deprotection
conditions. Consequently, the amino group of 2′-deoxy-2′-
(3c) was protected with the

(dimethylamino)ethylidene residue (→ 20, 82%) and a N,N-
diphenylcarbamoyl (DPC) residue was used to protect the 2-

nucleosides were cleaved from the solid support using
concentrated aqueous NH3/EtOH (3:1, v/v) and were
deprotected in this solution for 48 h at room temperature
(for details,
see the Experimental Section). All other
oligonucleotides were cleaved from CPG and ﬁnally depro-
tected in concentrated aqueous NH3 at 55 °C for 16 h. The
coupling yields of the modiﬁed building blocks were always
higher than 95%. All synthesized oligonucleotides were puriﬁed
by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-18), detritylated with 2.5%
dichloroacetic acid in dichloromethane and again puriﬁed by
HPLC. The contents of single peaks were isolated in all cases
(Figure S3, Supporting Information). Subsequently,
the

spectra. Table 1 displays all modiﬁed oligonucleotides used in

3. Synthesis and Characterization of Oligonucleo-
tides. It has been reported that the synthesis of oligonucleo-
tides (ODNs) containing 2′-ﬂuoro substituents is encountered
with diﬃculties.26 The problem results mainly from the
instability of 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoropyrimidine nucleosides. In our
study, it was necessary to apply conditions for oligonucleotide
synthesis, deprotection, and workup under which all six 2′-
deoxy-2′-ﬂuoronucleoside residues are stable.

Oligonucleotides were prepared on the solid phase using the
phosphoramidites 19 and 23 together with the phosphor-
amidites of nucleosides 2a and 3a (Figure S1, Supporting
Information) as well as the standard phosphoramidites and
applying the standard protocol for solid-phase oligonucleotide

Due to the low hydrolytic stability of iCd, the oligonucleotide
41 and related oligomers used for the construction of ps DNA
contain always MeiCd (Table 3).1c,e For the ﬂuorinated iCd (1c)
a structural stabilization by the 5-methyl group was not
necessary as the ﬂuorinated compound is more stable than the
nonﬂuorinated counterpart. Moreover,
is known that
pyrimidine 5-methyl groups stabilize the DNA duplex structure
depending on the content and positioning in duplex DNA. This
matter has already been investigated on parallel and antiparallel
DNA.1c,e,27,28 To demonstrate this eﬀect
the 12-mer
duplexes used in this study, duplex 5′-d(UAGGUCAAUACU)
(24-dU)·3′-d(AUCCAGUUAUGA) (25-dU) was prepared
(replacing dT by dU),1c Tm values were determined and
compared to those obtained for duplex 24·25 containing dT.
The diﬀerence in the Tm values between duplex 24·25
(containing dT) and 24-dU·25-dU (containing dU) amounts
to only 2 °C (see Table S3, Supporting Information). The
eﬀect is even smaller when one strand was ﬂuorinated (ΔTm =
+1 °C; 28·25 vs 28·25-dU).

Duplexes with Antiparallel Chain Orientation. In a ﬁrst
series of experiments, duplex stability was studied on helices
with antiparallel chain orientation containing canonical
nucleobases (Table 2; for thermodynamic data, see Table S4,
Supporting Information).
In the context of antisense
therapeutics, the upper strands can be considered as antisense
oligonucleotides and the lower ones as RNA or DNA target.
The data displayed in Table 2 show that the most stable duplex
is the fully 2′-ﬂuorinated duplex 28·29 with aps orientation (Tm
= 82 °C) (for melting curves see Figure S7, Supporting
Information). Its Tm is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the
corresponding RNA duplex 30·26 (Tm = 61 °C). 2′-
Fluorination of one strand of duplex DNA (24·25 vs 28·25)
causes a Tm increase of 12 °C, while for the DNA−RNA hybrid
28·26 a Tm increase of 22 °C was observed. The changes
observed for these 12-mer duplexes are in line with previous
reports made on other ﬂuorinated oligonucleotides.6b,9a
Hydrophobic properties of the ﬂuorine residue which aﬀect
hydration by changing the water spine in the helix groove also
have to be considered.29

It is accepted that the Tm increase induced by the ﬂuorine
substituents results from conformational changes of the DNA
B-form to the A-form. Both forms show signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
CD spectra. Exemplarily, CD spectra were determined for
selected ﬂuorinated and nonﬂuorinated 12-mer duplex DNA,
duplex RNA, and DNA−RNA hybrids (see Table 2 and Figure
4, Figure S8 Supporting Information). According to Figure 4,
RNA duplex 30·26, ﬂuorinated DNA-RNA hybrid 28·26 as well
as duplex DNA 28·29 with both strands ﬂuorinated are in the A

As mentioned above, nucleoside shape mimics with a
pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine or a pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine skel-
eton replacing the nucleobases of dA or dT and iGd or iCd have
been shown to be well accommodated in ps DNA and add
additional stability to the parallel helix structure.4 However, it
remains to be shown if modiﬁcations in the sugar moiety are
accepted by ps DNA. In this context, only the inﬂuence of a 2′-
methoxy group on ps DNA stability was reported.31 As
discussed above, the 2′-ﬂuoro (down) substituent has a positive
inﬂuence on the stability of 12-mer duplexes with antiparallel
chain orientation, and a similar behavior was anticipated for ps
DNA. Consequently, a series of duplexes with parallel chain
orientation was constructed, and the stability was studied by
thermal denaturation experiments.
To this end, the inﬂuence of the 2′-ﬂuoro substituent on the

monomeric “isonucleosides” 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisoguanosine
(3c) and 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisocytidine (1c) was investigated.
As the stability data of 2′-ﬂuorinated duplexes will be compared
with those of oligoribonucleotide and oligodeoxyribonucleotide
duplexes,
the conformational analysis was extended to a
number of ﬂuorinated and nonﬂuorinated nucleosides with
canonical bases.32

The conformation study was performed using the program
PSEUROT (version 6.3).33 The input used the following
coupling constants: 3J(H1′, H2′), 3J(H2′, H3′), 3J(H3′, H4′),
3J(H1′, F), and 3J(H3′, F). The coupling constants were taken
from well-resolved 1H NMR spectra measured in D2O or
DMSO-d6. Figure 7 summarizes not only the data of the
isonucleosides but also those of the corresponding canonical
DNA and RNA constituents and their 2′-ﬂuorinated derivatives.
From Figure 7 it is apparent that the pentofuranose moiety of
all ﬂuoronucleosides prefers the N-conformation. The degree of
the N population is higher for the ﬂuorinated pyrimidine
nucleosides than for those with a purine skeleton. This is valid
for the nucleosides with canonical nucleobases as well as for
isonucleosides. On the contrary, purine and pyrimidine ribo-
and 2′-deoxyribonucleosides prefer the S-type sugar pucker as
long as they are not constituents of a nucleic acid. A
comparison of 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisoguanosine (3c), isoguano-
sine (3b), and 2′-deoxyisoguanosine (3a) shows that the 2′-
ﬂuoro substituent
the N-conformer population
signiﬁcantly, which is the conformation of the sugar moiety
in RNA.34 The same is valid for the 2′-ﬂuorinated isocytidine
1c. However, the conformational parameters determined for
nucleosides are not necessarily the same as those found in
oligonucleotide duplexes.

increases

Next, the stability of ﬂuorinated and nonﬂuorinated duplexes
with parallel strand orientation was studied. At ﬁrst, non-
ﬂuorinated duplexes were measured (Table 3,
left row). As
expected from previous observations by our laboratory, the Tm
values of ps 12-mer duplexes are about 15 °C lower than those
−dG base
with aps orientation.1c The iGd
pairs both stabilize the duplex structure compared to duplexes
containing only dA−dT base pairs. Surprisingly, the complete
ﬂuorination of one strand did not increase the duplex stability
over that of the nonﬂuorinated counterpart. Only a small
positive eﬀect was found for duplex 28·41, while another
duplex (39·42) was slightly less stable (for melting curves see

the following coupling constants: 3J(H1′, H2′), 3J(H2′, H3′), 3J(H3′, H4′), 3J(H1′, F), 3J(H3′, F).

hybridization of oligonucleotides 46 and 47.

Figure S9, Supporting Information). This result was unexpected
as aps DNA shows a strong duplex stabilizing response to 2′-
ﬂuorination. More surprisingly, ﬂuorinated oligonucleotides
could not be hybridized with complementary RNA under
parallel chain orientation. A Tm value was not detectable for
duplexes 43·38, 39·44, and 39·45 (Table 3, right row). Taken
together, ﬂuorinated oligonucleotides are able to form ps
duplexes of signiﬁcant stability with complementary non-
ﬂuorinated DNA (for thermodynamic data, see Table S5,
Supporting Information); ps hybrids of ﬂuorinated DNA
strands and RNA strands are unstable.
We anticipate that the unexpected behavior upon 2′-ﬂuoro
functionalization is a special feature of parallel DNA. According
to NMR measurements and modeling studies, parallel DNA
forms a unique structure with a number of properties similar to
aps DNA, while others are diﬀerent.35 The orientation of the
nucleobases in ps DNA is anti, and the sugar conformation is in
the S-domain similar to aps DNA. The helix is right handed
with a diameter of about 20 nm, which is almost the same for ps
and aps DNA. The reduced stability results from weaker
stacking interactions and the weaker hydrogen bonding of the
dA−dT Donohue base pair. The helical parameters of ps and
aps DNA are diﬀerent,
leading to two grooves with almost
identical width (8−9 Å) for ps DNA compared to 6 and 12 Å
width in aps DNA. The interstrand C1′−C1′ distance in ps
DNA is ∼11.4 Å, which is almost 2 Å larger than in aps DNA.35
According to our ﬁndings, we propose that parallel DNA is
less ﬂexible than canonical DNA, which exists in various
structures (A and B form). Consequently, ps DNA reacts
sensitively to sugar backbone changes. 2′-Fluoro “down”
nucleosides which favor the N-conformation might add too
much strain to the helix and drive the nucleobases in an
unfavorable pairing position.31 Factors like steric clashes by the
2′-ﬂuoro substituents also have to be considered. This leads to
the question if RNA with the sugar
residues in the N
conformation is able to form stable duplexes with parallel
strand alignment. Toward this end, we tried to construct a
parallel-stranded 25-mer RNA−RNA duplex by hybridizing the
complementary RNA single strands 5′-(AAAAAAAAAAUAA-
UUUUAAAUAUUUU) (46) and 5′-(UUUUUUUUUUA-
UUAAAAUUUAUAAAA) (47). Both strands do not contain
iGd and MeiCd residues, and the strand orientation is solely
controlled by the sequence, a methodology which was already
applied to 25-mer duplex DNA.27 In agreement with our

observations made on 2′-ﬂuoro-2′-deoxyribonucleosides, it was
not possible to generate a parallel RNA duplex (no Tm), while
the corresponding antiparallel duplex showed a Tm value of 52
°C.
strand
orientation is limited to duplex DNA and DNA−RNA hybrids,
while two ﬂuorinated DNA strands do not hybridize under
parallel strand alignment.

■ CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
A diversity of complementary oligonucleotides with ﬂuorine
substitution at the 2′-position of 2′-deoxyisoguanosine and 2′-
deoxyisocytidine and at
the canonical DNA residues was
synthesized. To this end, syntheses for 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroiso-
cytidine (1c) and 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisoguanosine (3c) were
developed. 2′-Deoxy-2′-ﬂuoroisonucleosides 1c and 3c were
converted to building blocks (phosphoramidites) for solid-
phase oligonucleotide synthesis. Unexpectedly, 2′-deoxy-2′-
ﬂuoroisocytidine is not
stable in concentrated aqueous
ammonia at 55 °C (16 h treatment) and was converted to
the cyclonucleoside 14. Side product formation of nucleoside
1c was minimized, and not observed during oligonucleotide
deprotection with an aqueous ammonia−EtOH mixture (3:1,
v/v) at room temperature.
As anticipated, 2′-ﬂuorine substituents lead to a signiﬁcant
increased stability in antiparallel duplexes depending on the
·FiCd
number of ﬂuorine modiﬁcations. The ﬂuorinated FiGd
(3c·1c) base pair is as stable as its nonﬂuorinated counterpart
and more stable than the dG−dC pair. The situation changes
for ﬂuorinated duplexes with parallel chain orientation.
Although ﬂuorinated DNA single strands form stable ps
duplexes with nonﬂuorinated DNA, they are less stable than
their antiparallel counterparts (Figure 8). Furthermore, the
ﬂuorine functionalization does not add additional stability to
the DNA duplex structure. Apparently, ﬂuoro nucleoside
residues which prefer
the N-conformation have diﬃculty
adopting the required sugar conformation in parallel DNA,
which appears to be closer to S than to N.

Consequently, hybridization of single-stranded ﬂuorinated
oligonucleotides with complementary RNA strands did not
result in duplex formation. This is also valid for 25-mer RNA
strands which did not hybridize with parallel chain alignment.
These ﬁndings might shed more light on the question why
evolution has used the principle of antiparallel chain

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

General Methods and Materials. All chemicals and solvents
were of laboratory grade as obtained from commercial suppliers and
were used without further puriﬁcation. Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on TLC aluminum sheets covered with silica
gel 60 F254 (0.2 mm). Flash column chromatography (FC): silica gel
60 (40−60 μM, for ﬂash chromatography) at 0.4 bar. UV spectra: λ
max
(ε) in nm, ε in dm3 mol−1 cm−1. NMR spectra were measured at
300.15 MHz for 1H, 75.48 MHz for 13C, 121.52 MHz for 31P, and

282.4 MHz for 19F. The J values are given in hertz; δ values are given
in ppm relative to Me4Si as internal standard. For NMR spectra
recorded in DMSO-d6, the chemical shift of the solvent peak was set to
2.50 ppm for 1H NMR and 39.50 ppm for 13C NMR. The 13C NMR
signals were assigned on the basis of DEPT-135 and 1H−13C gated-
decoupled NMR spectra (Tables 4 and 5; for coupling constants see
Tables S1and S2 in the Supporting Information). Reversed-phase
HPLC was carried out on a 4 × 250 mm RP-18 (10 μM) LiChrospher
100 column with a HPLC pump connected with a variable wavelength
monitor, a controller, and an integrator. ESI-TOF mass spectra of
nucleosides were recorded on a Micro-TOF spectrometer. Molecular
masses of oligonucleotides were determined by MALDI-TOF mass

Synthesis, Puriﬁcation, and Characterization of Oligonu-
cleotides. The oligonucleotides were synthesized on an automated
DNA synthesizer on a 1 μmol scale employing standard phosphor-
amidites as well as the phosphoramidites 1c and 3c. After cleavage
from the solid support, the oligonucleotides were deprotected in
concentrated aqueous ammonia solution for 16 h at 55 °C.
Oligonucleotides containing 2′-deoxy-2′-ﬂuoro nucleosides were
cleaved from the solid support by storage of
in
concentrated aqueous NH3/EtOH (3:1, v/v) for 1 h. The supernatant
was separated from the CPG and kept in concentrated aqueous NH3/
EtOH (3:1, v/v) for 48 h at room temperature. The puriﬁcation of the
“trityl-on” oligonucleotides was carried out on reversed-phase HPLC
using the following gradient system at 260 nm: (A) MeCN; (B) 0.1 M
(Et3NH)OAc (pH 7.0):MeCN, 95:5; gradient I: 0−3 min 10−15% A
in B, 3−15 min 15−50% A in B, ﬂow rate 0.8 mL/min. The puriﬁed
“trityl-on” oligonucleotides were treated with 2.5% CHCl2COOH/
CH2Cl2 for 2 min at 0 °C to remove the 4,4′-dimethoxytrityl residues.
The detritylated oligomers were puriﬁed again by reversed-phase
HPLC (column 4 × 250 mm) with gradient II: 0−20 min 0−20% A in
B, 20−25 min, 20% A in B, ﬂow rate 0.8 mL/min. The
oligonucleotides were desalted on RP-18 (column 4 × 125 mm)
using water for elution of salt, while the oligonucleotides were eluted
with H2O/MeOH (2:3). The oligonucleotides were lyophilized on a
Speed-Vac evaporator to yield colorless or yellow solids which were
frozen at −24 °C. The molecular masses of the oligonucleotides were
determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in the linear positive
mode. Extinction coeﬃcients ε

and alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1, Escherichia coli) in 0.1 M Tris−
HCl buﬀer (pH 8.5) at 37 °C. The enzymatic digestion products were
analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC using the following gradient.

was suspended in H2O (18 mL) at 50 °C, and NaNO2 (0.541 g, 7.73
mmol) in H2O (4 mL) was introduced. Then, acetic acid (0.833 g,
0.79 mL, 13.87 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution at 50 °C in
2 min. The resulting clear solution was stirred for 20 min at 50 °C.
After completion of the reaction (TLC monitoring), the reaction
mixture was diluted with water (8 mL) and cooled in an ice bath, and
then concd aq NH3 was added dropwise until the pH reached 8. Then
the solution was evaporated, and the remaining residue was
redissolved in 50 mL of water. The pH of the solution was adjusted
to 5−6, and the solution was passed through a pad of RP-18 silica gel
(mesh 40−63 μM, 50 g). Inorganic salts were removed with water (2
