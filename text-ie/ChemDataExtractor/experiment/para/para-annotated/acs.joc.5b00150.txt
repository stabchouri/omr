ABSTRACT: 1,1′-Bi-2-naphthol in combination with ZnEt2,
Ti(OiPr)4, and dicyclohexylamine have been employed to
catalyze asymmetric alkyne addition to an ynal to synthesize
optically active propargylic alcohols containing two alkyne
functions with excellent yields and enantioselectivities. These
chiral alcohols are readily converted to the corresponding
optically active propargyl 2,4-hexadienyl ethers. These diene-
diyne substrates are found to undergo a highly chemoselective
and stereoselective domino Pauson−Khand and Diels−Alder
cycloaddition catalyzed by [RhCl(CO)2]2 under CO to generate a class of tetracyclic compounds with high enantiomeric purity.
This is a very eﬃcient method for the asymmetric synthesis of polycyclic compounds.

■ INTRODUCTION

Over the past decade, signiﬁcant progress has been made on
the catalytic asymmetric alkyne addition to aldehydes to
generate chiral propargylic alcohols.1−3 For example,
in our
laboratory, we have discovered that the readily available 1,1′-bi-
2-naphthol (BINOL) in combination with ZnEt2 and Ti(OiPr)4
can catalyze the highly enantioselective reaction of a broad
range of alkynes with aldehydes.3 Addition of a catalytic
amount of dicyclohexylamine (Cy2NH) allows the entire
catalytic process to be conducted at room temperature.3c,d
Using the BINOL-based catalytic system can quickly produce
structurally diverse chiral propargylic alcohols with high
enantiomeric purity. This has prompted us to explore the
application of these chiral propagylic alcohols in the asymmetric
synthesis of multicyclic organic compounds.4

Scheme 1 shows an example of a Rh(I)-catalyzed domino
cyclization of a chiral propargylic alcohol derivative we recently

and Catalytic Conversion of a Chiral Propargyl Allyl Ether to
a Pentacyclic Product

reported.4a A chiral propargylic alcohol was obtained from the
BINOL-based catalytic enyne addition to an aldehyde with high
enantiomeric purity. After preparation of its allylic ether, it was
treated with a Rh(I) catalyst under CO, which catalyzed a
domino cycloaddition to give a multicyclic product. In this
paper, we report our further development of this strategy by
conducting the Rh(I)-catalyzed domino cyclization of chiral
propargyl 2,4-hexadienyl ethers. This process eﬃciently
generates multicyclic products with high diastereoselectivity
and high enantiomeric purity.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub="scope">
Preparation of Chiral Propargylic Alcohols by the
Catalytic Asymmetric Alkyne Addition to Aldehydes
and Their Conversion to 2,4-Hexadienyl Ethers. We have
conducted the asymmetric alkyne addition to 5-(trimethylsilan-
yl)pent-5-ynal
to synthesize a series of chiral propargylic
alcohols containing two alkyne functions. As shown in Table 1,
in the presence of (S)-BINOL, ZnEt2, Cy2NH, and Ti(OiPr)4,
the reaction of various terminal alkynes with the ynal gave the
corresponding diynols (R)-1a−g with good yields (69−95%)
and high enantioselectivity (86−92% ee). Both the aromatic
alkynes and aliphatic alkynes show similarly high stereo-
selectivity. These reactions were conducted in diethyl ether
solution at room temperature under nitrogen in a three-step−
one-pot process. In the ﬁrst step, an alkyne was treated with
ZnEt2, Cy2NH, and (S)-BINOL, which presumably generated a
nucleophilic alkynylzinc reagent. The Lewis base Cy2NH could
increase the basicity of Et2Zn for the deprotonation of the
alkyne. In the second step, the deprotonated (S)-BINOL in the
ﬁrst step was combined with Ti(OiPr)4 to generate a chiral

We have introduced conjugated diene unit into the above
optically active diynols by reacting with 1-bromo-2,4-hexadiene
under basic conditions. As shown in Table 2, treatment of (R)-
1a−g with tBuOK followed by addition of 1-bromo-2,4-
hexadiene at room temperature gave the corresponding ether
products (R)-2a−g in 50−86% yield. In this step, the TMS
group was also removed. This allows the introduction of other
groups on the alkyne unit. For example, treatment of (R)-2a
with nBuLi followed by addition of MeI gave the methylated
product (R)-3-Me. The TMS group was also placed back on
the alkyne unit to give compounds (R)-3a−g in good yields.
Compounds (R)-3 are optically active propargyl 2,4-hexadienyl
ethers containing two alkyne functions and a conjugated diene.
These compounds are designed to undergo a metal-promoted
domino Pauson−Khand and Diels−Alder cycloaddition.

The structure of 4a was established by high-resolution mass
1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopic analysis and various
spectroscopic analyses, including COSY, NOESY, HSQC, and
DEPT-135 (Figure 1). In the 1H NMR spectrum of 4a, the
signals at δ 3.61 (d, 1H, J = 3.2 Hz), 3.75 (dd, 1H, J = 12.8, 8
Hz), and 4.16 (t, 1H, J = 7.2 Hz) are attributed to H1, H2, and
H3, respectively. The 1H NMR signal of H11 at δ 1.07 is shifted
unusually upﬁeld in comparison with that of H10 at δ 2.08 on
the same carbon. We attribute this to the shielding eﬀect of the
Ph group of 4a on H11. In the 13C NMR spectrum, the carbonyl
signal of 4a is observed at δ 211.5 and the TMS-substituted
vinyl carbon signal is observed at δ 192.6. The carbon bearing
H1 gives a signal at δ 80.9 and that bearing H2 and H3 at δ 69.7.

Single crystals of compound 4d were obtained by slow
evaporation of its hexane/isopropyl alcohol solution. An X-ray
analysis of these single crystals has allowed us to determine the
structure of 4d, as shown in Figure 2. This conﬁrms the
structural assignment derived by analogy with that of 4a
determined by NMR analysis. The bond angles around the
central quaternary carbon of 4d are found to be 100.0−116.6°

angle C(2)−C(1)−C(12) being the smallest. These data are
very close to those calculated for 4a.

Previously, Chung reported a Co-catalyzed cyclization of
racemic dienediynes to give racemic tetracyclic products similar
to 4a.5 The use of the Co catalyst required higher temperature
(130 °C) and higher pressure (30 atm) of CO in comparison to
those for the use of the Rh catalyst reported here. In Chung’s
work, the stereostructure of the product is also diﬀerent from
that of 4a, which could be due to either a diﬀerent reaction
mechanism or a possible error in assignment.

Coordination of (R)-3a with [RhCl(CO)2]2 can generate the
intermediate 5. Oxidative coupling of the coordinated triple
bonds of 5 gives 6. Migratory insertion of 6 with CO followed
by reductive elimination should give the PK cycloaddition
product 7. When both of the alkyne units contain a TMS
group, as in 3j,
it should be more diﬃcult to generate a
corresponding intermediate similar to 5 due to the steric
interaction of the two bulky TMS groups in the intermediate,
and thus no PK cycloaddition of the two alkyne units of 3j was
observed. The cyclopentadienone unit of the intermediate 7 is
expected to be highly reactive, which readily undergoes an
intramolecular endo-DA cycloaddition to give the tetracyclic
product 4a. In this step, the cis Hβ and Hγ atoms on the newly
to Hα on the
formed chiral centers are cis with respect
propargylic chiral center, whereas Ph and Me are trans with
respect to each other. The stereochemistry of the isolated
product supports this mechanism.

Conclusion. Using the chiral propargylic alcohols prepared
from the catalytic asymmetric alkyne addition to aldehydes, we
have synthesized a series of optically active propargyl 2,4-
hexadienyl ethers. These compounds are found to undergo a
one-pot Rh(I)-catalyzed intramolecular domino PK/DA cyclo-
addition under mild reaction conditions to generate optically
active tetracyclic products with high chemoselectivity and
stereoselectivity. We have demonstrated that
the high
enantiomeric purity of
the propargylic alcohols generated
from the catalytic asymmetric alkyne addition is maintained in
the domino cycloaddition products. This strategy is very
eﬃcient for the asymmetric synthesis of polycyclic compounds.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Data. All commercial chemicals were used without further
puriﬁcation unless otherwise noted. All catalysts were purchased and
stored under a dry nitrogen atmosphere. Tetrahydrofuran was distilled
over sodium and benzophenone under nitrogen. Diethyl ether and
methylene chloride were dried by passing through activated alumina
columns under nitrogen. All the NMR spectra were obtained in CDCl3
unless indicated otherwise.

General Procedure for the Catalytic Asymmetric Alkyne
Addition to Aldehydes. Under nitrogen, (S)-BINOL (40 mol %)
was weighed into a tared ﬂask and dissolved in Et2O (9 mL). An
alkyne (4 equiv), Cy2NH (5 mol %), and Et2Zn (4 equiv) were added,
and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. Then,
Ti(OiPr)4 (1 equiv) was added and stirring was continued for 3 h. An
aldehyde (0.75 mmol, 1 equiv) was added and the mixture was stirred
for another 4 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated
aqueous ammonium chloride and extracted three times with CH2Cl2.

compounds 3 should be more facile than the DA cycloaddition

General Procedure for Preparation of the Optically Active
Propargyl 2,4-Hexadienyl Ethers (R)-3. Under nitrogen, (R)-2 (1
equiv) was dissolved in THF (5 mL) and cooled to −78 °C under
nitrogen. nBuLi (2.5 M in hexane, 1.2 equiv) was added, and the
mixture was stirred for 30 min. Then TMSCl or MeI (3 equiv) was
added and the system was stirred for 18 h at room temperature. The
reaction was quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride
solution and extracted with CH2Cl2 three times. The organic layer was
washed with brine, dried with Na2SO4, concentrated by rotary
evaporation, and puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel with
hexanes/dichloromethane to give the products (R)-3 in 70−91% yield.

General Procedure for the Catalytic Domino PK/DA Cyclo-
addition. Under nitrogen, a propargyl 2,4-hexadienyl ether (1 equiv)
and [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 (0.1 equiv) were weighed into a tared two-necked
round-bottom ﬂask and dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE, 5 mL).
The ﬂask was ﬁtted with a reﬂux condenser equipped with a septum,
and the side arm of the ﬂask was also equipped with a septum. The
solution was bubbled with CO gas for 2 min through the side arm
equipped with a septum and a vent needle in the septum of the reﬂux
condenser in a well-vented fume hood. Then, the solution was placed
under a CO atmosphere by using a balloon. After the reaction mixture
was heated at 80 °C to reﬂux temperature for 19−26 h, it was cooled
to room temperature and the CO was released cautiously in the fume
hood. The reaction mixture was concentrated, and the crude product
was puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel with hexanes/
ethyl acetate to give the tetracyclic products 4 with 42−64% yield and
87−88% ee.
