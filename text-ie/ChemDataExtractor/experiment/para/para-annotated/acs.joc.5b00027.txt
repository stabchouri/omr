the C1−C13 fragment of symbiodinolide, which were proposed by the
ABSTRACT: Four possible diastereomers of
stereostructural analysis of the degraded product, were synthesized in a stereodivergent and stereoselective manner. The key
transformations were aldol reaction of methyl acetoacetate with the aldehyde, diastereoselective reduction of the resulting β-
hydroxy ketone, and the stereoinversion at the C6 position. Comparison of the 1H NMR data between the four synthetic
products and the degraded product revealed the relative stereostructure of the C1−C13 fragment of symbiodinolide.

■ INTRODUCTION

Integrated use of a spectroscopic method and chemical
synthesis is well recognized as a reliable approach to the
structural elucidation of natural products.1 In particular, if the
target molecule has a huge molecular size or a number of
functional groups, the chemical synthesis is often required for
the unambiguous conﬁgurational assignment.2

Symbiodinolide (1, Figure 1), a 62-membered polyol
macrolide marine natural product, was isolated from the 80%
aqueous ethanol extract of
the cultured dinoﬂagellate
Symbiodinium sp. by one of the authors (D.U.).3 This natural
product exhibits voltage-dependent N-type Ca2+ channel-
opening activity at 7 nM and COX-1 inhibition eﬀect at 2
μM (65% inhibition). The planar structure of symbiodinolide
(1) was assigned by the detailed 2D NMR spectroscopic
techniques. However, the stereostructure of 1 has not been
elucidated yet because of its complicated molecular structure
characterized by 61 stereocenters and molecular weight of
2860. Therefore, we are now examining the degradation of
natural symbiodinolide (1)3,4 and chemical synthesis of each
fragment including the stereoisomers5 toward the complete
stereochemical establishment of 1. Previously, as a degradation
of symbiodinolide (1), we carried out the methanolysis and
subsequent oxidative cleavage with Grubbs II catalyst/NaClO

to yield the C1−C13 fragment 2 (Scheme 1).4a,c Herein, as a
part of our eﬀorts
toward the complete conﬁgurational
determination of symbiodinolide (1), we describe the stereo-
structural analysis of the degraded product 2, and stereo-
divergent and stereoselective synthesis of all
four possible
the C1−C13 fragment 2,6 which has
diastereomers of
established the relative stereostructure of this fragment.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Stereochemical Analysis of the Degraded Product 2.
Prior to starting the synthesis of the C1−C13 fragment, we ﬁrst
analyzed the stereostructure of the degraded product 2 to
reduce the number of
this
fragment. As shown in Figure 2a, the chemical shifts of the H-5
and H-7 in the 1H NMR spectrum were the same value (3.97
ppm in D2O); in addition, the two coupling constants were also
the same (3J5,6 and 3J6,7 = 4.5 Hz). Comparison of these results
with universal NMR databases for 1,2,3-triols reported by Kishi
and co-workers7 indicates that
the relative stereochemical
relationships at the C5 and C7 positions to the C6 position are
the same, that is, syn/syn or anti/anti. Thus, the possible

the possible diastereomers of

Scheme 2. Aldol reaction of methyl acetoacetate (3) with
aldehyde 4 would provide the coupling product 5 with the
desired oxymethine stereochemistry at the C5 position. The
substrate-controlled diastereoselective reduction of β-hydroxy
ketone 5 by utilizing the resulting C5 stereochemistry with the
appropriate reducing reagent could aﬀord syn-diol 6 and anti-
diol 7, respectively. The syn-diol 6 could be transformed to the
tetraol 2a through the deprotection and oxidation of the allylic
alcohol. The tetraol 2b would be also synthesized via the
stereoinversion at the C6 position from 6. In the similar way,
the tetraols 2c and 2d could be stereoselectively supplied,
respectively, by using the anti-diol 7 as the common synthetic
intermediate.
<para sub="scope">
Stereoselective Synthesis of 2a. We investigated the
stereoselective synthesis of the ﬁrst target molecule 2a. Parikh−
Doering oxidation9 of the known alcohol 8, which was prepared
from 2-deoxy-D-ribose in four steps,10 followed by two-carbon
elongation with (EtO)2P(O)CH2CO2Et and DIBAL-H reduc-
tion, provided allylic alcohol 9 in 77% yield in three steps
(Scheme 3). The alcohol 9 was protected as the TBDPS ether,
and the regioselective reductive cleavage of the p-methox-
ybenzylidene acetal moiety with DIBAL-H aﬀorded primary
alcohol 10. The alcohol 10 was oxidized to the corresponding
·pry/Et3N/DMSO.9 Stereoselective aldol
aldehyde with SO3
addition of methyl acetoacetate (3) to the resulting α,β-bis-
alkoxy aldehyde by using NaH and n-BuLi as bases produced β-
hydroxy ketone 11 possessing the desired C5 conﬁguration in
94% yield as the inseparable 6:1 diastereomeric mixture.11,12
We next tried the derivatization of 11 for the stereochemical
conﬁrmation at the C5 position. Thus, removal of the TBDPS
protective group with HF·pyr and subsequent oxidation of the
13 gave unsaturated
allylic alcohol with TEMPO/PhI(OAc)2
aldehyde 12. Treatment of the alcohol 12 with DDQ provided
p-methoxybenzylidene acetal 13.14 The observed NOEs of Ha/
Hb, Ha/Hc, and Hb/Hc in 13, as shown by arrows, indicated
that they were in syn relationships. Thereby, the absolute
stereochemistry at the C5 position of 11 was unambiguously
conﬁrmed. Next, we introduced the C3 oxymethine stereo-
chemistry. Thus, diastereoselective reduction of 11 was carried
15 to aﬀord syn-diol 14 in 98% yield
out with Et2BOMe/NaBH4
as a single product (Scheme 4). For
the stereochemical
conﬁrmation at the C3 position, the diol 14 was protected with
p-MeOC6H4CH(OMe)2/CSA to give p-methoxybenzylidene
acetal 15. The NOE correlations of Ha/Hb, Ha/Hc, and Hb/
Hc in 15 suggested that all of them were oriented in axial
positions, respectively. Thus, the absolute conﬁguration at the
C3 position of 14 was elucidated.

<para sub="scope">
Next, we examined the transformation of the diol 14 to the
tetraol 2a. Protection of 14 with Me2C(OMe)2/p-TsOH·H2O
gave acetonide 16 (Scheme 5). The TBDPS moiety of 16 was
selectively removed with TBAF/AcOH16 to provide allylic
alcohol 17 in 68% yield. TEMPO oxidation13 of 17 and
removal of the PMB group with DDQ aﬀorded unsaturated
aldehyde 18 in 94% yield in two steps. The acetonide moiety of
17 in CH2Cl2 at −30 °C to aﬀord
18 was removed with TiCl4
triol 19 in 98% yield. Finally, treatment of the TBS ether 19
with HF·pyr at 0 °C to room temperature produced the tetraol
2a. Although we could obtain the ﬁrst target molecule 2a, the
conversion of 19 to 2a was quite slow and the starting material
19 was recovered in 52% yield. When the reaction time was
prolonged, we observed the formation of several byproducts;
furthermore, this transformation was irreproducible. Since this
deprotection would be problematic in the subsequent synthesis

Stereoselective Synthesis of 2b. We next examined the
stereoselective synthesis of the second target molecule 2b,

subjected to the TPAP
oxidation19 to aﬀord ketone 23 (Scheme 7). Diastereoselective
reduction of 23 with NaBH4 proceeded successfully to provide
the desired alcohol 24 in 98% yield as the sole diastereomer.
This stereochemical outcome is in line with a Felkin−Anh
model, which is doubly eﬀected by the C5 and C7 stereogenic
centers. The 1H NMR spectrum of 24 was clearly diﬀerent
from that of the secondary alcohol obtained in the ﬁrst step

Stereoselective Synthesis of 2c and 2d. Having
completed the stereoselective and stereodivergent synthesis of
the ﬁrst and second target molecules 2a and 2b bearing the syn
relationships at the C3 and C5 positions, we next commenced
the synthesis of the third and fourth target molecules 2c and 2d
with the C3/C5 anti correlations. The stereoselective synthesis
of 2c is illustrated in Scheme 8. Treatment of the β-hydroxy
20 furnished the desired anti-diol
ketone 11 with NaBH(OAc)3
27 in 95% yield as a single diastereomer, as judged by its 1H
NMR spectrum, which was clearly diﬀerent from that of the
syn-diol 14. Further transformation of 27 toward 2c was similar
to that used in the synthesis of 2a. Protection of the resulting
diol moiety of 27 and desilylation aﬀorded diol 28. The diol 28
was transformed to unsaturated aldehyde 29 by the following
four-step sequence: (1) bis-silylation, (2) selective desilylation
of the primary TES moiety, (3) TEMPO oxidation13 of the
allylic alcohol, and (4) removal of
the PMB group.
Simultaneous removal of the acetonide and TES moieties was

The stereocontrolled synthesis of 2d, whose synthetic route
was analogous to that of 2b, is shown in Scheme 9. The alcohol
28, which was the key synthetic intermediate toward 2c, was
converted to ketone 30 through the selective silylation of the
primary alcohol and TPAP oxidation19 of
the secondary
alcohol. The ketone 30 was reduced with NaBH4 to give
alcohol 31 as the sole diastereomer. The resulting stereo-
chemistry at the C6 position of 31 was conﬁrmed by comparing
the 1H NMR spectra between 31 and the secondary alcohol
synthesized in the ﬁrst transformation from 28. Acetonide 32,
which was synthesized from the alcohol 31 in 54% overall yield

17 to provide the

Relative Stereostructure of the C1−C13 Fragment.
With all four possible diastereomers 2a−2d in hand, we next
compared these 1H NMR data with those of the degraded
product 2. As described in Table 1, the 1H NMR chemical
shifts of the synthetic 2b were found to be in full agreement
with those of the degraded product 2.21 On the other hand, the
1H NMR chemical shifts of the synthetic 2a, 2c, and 2d were
the degraded product 2,
clearly diﬀerent
respectively. Especially, the chemical shifts of two geminal
protons at the C4 position of 2a, 2c, and 2d were diﬀerent to
each other, respectively, whereas the chemical shifts of these
protons of 2 and 2b were found to be the same. Therefore, the
relative stereostructure of the C1−C13 fragment of symbiodi-
nolide (1) was elucidated to be that described in 2b.

diastereomers 2a−2d by comparing with the universal NMR
databases reported by Kishi’s research group. Next, we have
examined the stereodivergent synthesis of 2a−2d in the uniﬁed
manner. Thus, the β-hydroxy ketone 11, which would be the
key common synthetic intermediate of 2a−2d, was synthesized
by aldol reaction between methyl acetoacetate (3) and the
aldehyde derived from 10. Diastereoselective reduction of 11
provided the syn-diol 14 (by Et2BOMe/NaBH4) and the anti-
diol 27 (by NaBH(OAc)3), respectively. Deprotection and
oxidation of the allylic alcohol moiety of 14 produced the ﬁrst
target molecule 2a. The second target molecule 2b was
synthesized via the stereoinversion at
the C6 position by
diastereoselective reduction of the ketone 23. In the similar
synthetic route, the third and fourth target molecules 2c and 2d
were yielded from the anti-diol 27, respectively and stereo-
selectively. Comparison of the 1H NMR data of the synthetic
2a−2d with those of the degraded product 2 determined the
the C1−C13 fragment of
relative stereochemistry of
symbiodinolide (1) to be depicted in 2b.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
Allylic Alcohol 9. To a solution of allylic alcohol 8 (5.04 g, 12.8
mmol) in CH2Cl2 (51 mL) and DMSO (13 mL) were added Et3N
·pyr (4.07 g, 25.6 mmol) at 0 °C. The
(7.8 mL, 56.3 mmol) and SO3
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The mixture was
diluted with EtOAc, washed with saturated aqueous NH4Cl, H2O, and
brine, and then dried over Na2SO4. Concentration and column

chromatography (hexane/EtOAc = 10:1) gave the corresponding α,β-
unsaturated aldehyde (4.53 g), which was used for the next reaction
without further puriﬁcation.

To a suspension of NaH (60% dispersion in oil, 1.11 g, 27.8 mmol,
washed with hexane in advance) in benzene (15 mL) was added
(EtO)2P(O)CH2CO2Et (6.0 mL, 30.2 mmol) at 0 °C. After the
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min, the aldehyde
obtained above (4.53 g) in benzene (10 mL + 6.0 mL + 4.0 mL) was
added at room temperature. After the mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 2 h, the reaction was quenched with H2O at 0 °C. The
mixture was diluted with EtOAc, washed with H2O and brine, and
then dried over Na2SO4. Concentration and column chromatography
(hexane/EtOAc = 20:1) gave the corresponding α,β-unsaturated ester
(4.85 g), which was used for the next reaction without
further
puriﬁcation.

To a solution of the ester obtained above (4.85 g) in CH2Cl2 (50
mL) was added DIBAL-H (1.04 M solution in hexane, 20 mL, 20.8
mmol) at −78 °C. After the mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 30 min,
the reaction was quenched with MeOH. The mixture was ﬁltered
through a Celite pad and washed with EtOAc. Concentration and

Alcohol 18. To a solution of alcohol 17 (102 mg, 0.176 mmol) in
CH2Cl2 (2.0 mL) were added PhI(OAc)2 (146 mg, 0.440 mmol) and
TEMPO (5.5 mg, 35.2 μmol) at 0 °C. After the mixture was stirred at
room temperature for 1 h, the reaction was quenched with saturated
aqueous Na2S2O3. The mixture was diluted with EtOAc, washed with
H2O and brine, and then dried over Na2SO4. Concentration and

(8) In ref 4c, we reported that
the relative stereostructural
relationships of the C5/C6 and C6/C7 could be proposed as syn
and syn, respectively. After the detailed consideration of the 1H NMR
data analysis, we concluded that we could not exclude the possibility of
the combination of anti (C5/C6) and anti (C6/C7) relationships.
Therefore, we decided to synthesize 2a−2d for the unambiguous
conﬁgurational determination.

(12) Our detailed examination of separating 11 and its C5-epimer
was unfruitful. The minor diastereomers, which were derived from the
C5-epimer of 11, could be separated by silica gel column
chromatography at the ﬁnal stage of 2a−2d, respectively.

(14) The transformation of 11 to the corresponding p-methox-
ybenzylidene acetal with DDQ was unsuccessful presumably due to
the incompatibility of the 1,3-diene moiety.
