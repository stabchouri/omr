ABSTRACT: Smooth and eﬃcient reaction conditions have been
found for the transformation of protected β-hydroxyacylsilanes into
the corresponding aldehydes. This opens a new route to iterative
aldol reactions, and it has been used for the synthesis of fragments
of several bioactive natural products.

■ INTRODUCTION

strategies

such as

The polypropionate skeleton, naturally synthesized by
enzymatic systems, is a widespread structure in natural products
and bioactive molecules.1 A privileged method for
the
preparation of this framework is the aldol reaction,2 although
the direct aldol cross-coupling of two aldehydes has been a
synthetic challenge for a long time. Recently, organocatalytic3
and Lewis acid catalyzed4 direct aldol reactions have provided
elegant solutions to circumvent to a large extent this problem.
Powerful methods employing “supersilyl” enol ethers5 and
isomerization−aldolization of
indirect
allylborates6 have also been described. Classical methods for
iterative synthesis still usually rely on the use of various
carboxylic acid derivatives as nucleophilic partners, allowing
high levels of stereocontrol by the choice of appropriate
reagents, chiral auxiliaries, catalysts, and reaction conditions.2
However, further transformation to the aldehyde requires step-
consuming redox adjustments. We have recently developed a
transition-metal-mediated tandem isomerization−aldol reaction
of α-hydroxyallylsilanes,7 aﬀording syn β-hydroxyacylsilanes
which have already demonstrated good synthetic potential.8−10
It appeared to us that a new strategy could be developed in
iterative aldol reactions toward polypropionate-derived mole-
cules, provided that appropriate conditions could be found for
transformations of β-hydroxyacylsilanes into aldols

Further, we used the previously described compounds 4f/5f
and 4g/5g bearing, respectively, TIPS and TBDPS substitu-
ents.7 We selected four classical protecting groups with
diﬀerent steric/electronic properties, acetate, benzoate, MOM,
and TBS, to aﬀord the corresponding derivatives (Table 2). A
screening of these protecting groups with the compounds 4a/
5a gave products 6a−13a in fair to excellent yields. Acetylation
and benzoylation proved to be more attractive since they allow,
in each case, separation of the major syn diastereoisomer.

The minor anti diastereoisomers could not be separated,

intermediate 16g has been described earlier.8a

In a second step, we studied the transformation of acylsilanes
into aldehydes to allow further synthetic transformations,
including iterative aldol reactions. A survey of the literature
including base-11 or ﬂuoride-
indicated several options,
induced12 protodesilylations, hydrogenolysis (provided the
silane bears at least one aryl group),13 LiAlH4 reduction,14
hydrolysis,15 or photolytic C−Si cleavage in a protic solvent.16
Among those, catalytic hydrogenation appeared interesting and
was applied to 16g, while base- or ﬂuoride-induced
protodesilylations were incompatible with our substrates. The
photochemical transformation of acylsilanes into aldehydes as
depicted in Scheme 3 appeared highly desirable,
though
challenging in the case of our protected β-hydroxyacylsilane
moieties. Indeed, a labile α proton and a potential leaving group
in the β position could result
in competitive elimination
reactions. To the best of our knowledge, a single example of
photolytic cleavage of β-alkoxyacylsilane has been reported to
date, as part of the synthesis of thymidine analogues.16c Thus,

by using 6a and 8a as models, extensive optimization studies
(solvent, temperature,
lamp, and concentration) have been
performed in order to deﬁne the best conditions. In particular,
solvents were found to play key roles in this process. By using
methanol or isopropanol alone, or as mixtures with water, the
intermediate acetals could be characterized by 1H NMR, but
their hydrolysis to the aldehyde proved to be challenging with
sensitive molecules. Therefore,
it was found that reactions
starting from 6a or 8a at 5.10−2 M in 1:2 to 1:4 mixtures of
acetone and water, combined with the use of a routine UV
lamp at 365 nm,17,18 aﬀorded directly the desired protected β-
hydroxyaldehydes 17a and 18a in excellent yields with a very

In order to investigate the scope and limitations of
this
procedure, we repeated the previously described sequence.
Compound 24 was acetylated under standard conditions,

Next, we intended to demonstrate the feasibility of an
iterative process toward stereotetrads1 on two representative

tandem reaction aﬀorded a 76:13:9:2 mixture of products (1H

In parallel, we checked the possible use of this iterative
strategy with acylsilanes bearing an aryl substituent on silicon.
Starting from previously described MOM protected β-
hydroxyacylsilane 16g,7,8 hydrogenolysis by the procedure
pioneered in Panek’s group13 aﬀorded in high yield the syn

lane 3 gave a 57:28:12:3 mixture of products (1H NMR analysis
of
the crude reaction mixture). After puriﬁcation by
chromatography and fractional crystallization, the major syn−
anti−syn derivative 27 was obtained in pure form and its syn−
anti−syn structure was also established by X-ray analysis.19
Thus, in both cases, the aldol process occurred preferentially
through an anti-Felkin mode, in agreement with our previous
results,7 and with reported use of syn aldols as acceptors.20

We ﬁnally applied our strategy to the synthesis of known
intermediates for natural products synthesis (Scheme 5).
Compound 31 is a common fragment for the synthesis of
arenamides21 and the C1-C9 subunit of tylonolide.22 By using
our method, it has been synthesized in three steps and 48%
overall yield from α-hydroxyallylsilane 1. The tandem isomer-
ization−aldol reaction with aldehyde 28 gave 29, as a 83:17
mixture of syn and anti aldols. After protection as its TBS ether,
the major syn isomer 30 was isolated by chromatography.

the
transformation into aldehyde occurred smoothly, aﬀording in
excellent yield derivative 31, whose spectral data are in full

We also used this strategy to the preparation of the C5-C11
fragment of pironetine, a natural product with immunosup-
pressant activities.23 Several syntheses of this molecule have
been already reported,24 while our method is described in
Scheme 5. Starting from aldehyde 32,25 a ﬁrst
tandem
isomerization−aldol sequence aﬀorded syn aldol 33 as the
major isomer puriﬁed by chromatography. After protection as
its TBS ether, the transformation of acylsilane 34 into aldehyde
35 was successfully performed using the same photolytic
conditions. This derivative is already a known intermediate for
the total synthesis of Panamycin 607,26a and Gephyronic
acid.26b A second tandem aldol reaction gave, after separation
of
the diastereoisomers by silica gel chromatography,
intermediate 36 as the major isomer. The transformation into
the diol 37 was performed in a two-step, one-pot sequence.
the intermediate aldehyde was obtained from the
First,
acylsilane unit under
the same photolytic conditions as
previously. This was followed immediately by in situ reduction
with NaBH4 and aqueous workup to aﬀord diol 37 in 70% yield
from 36. The spectroscopical data of 37 were matching with
those already reported for a known intermediate of pironetine
synthesis.25a Diol 37 was obtained in 23% overall yield and six
steps, including two tandem isomerization−aldol reactions and
two photolytic transformations of acylsilanes into aldehydes.
The last example is noteworthy since it establishes that this
photolytic transformation can be performed, albeit in lower
yield, on a nonprotected β-hydroxyacylsilane to aﬀord the
corresponding β-hydroxyaldehyde.

Scheme 5. Application to the Synthesis of Fragments for Three Natural Products

■ CONCLUSION

In summary, we have demonstrated a new strategy toward
iterative aldol processes based on the use of α-hydroxyallylsi-
lanes as propionaldehyde enolates equivalents. It is based on
two key steps, the ﬁrst is the tandem isomerization−aldol
reaction, allowing the preparation of β-alkoxyacylsilanes, and
the second is an easy and eﬃcient transformation of
the
acylsilane unit into the aldehyde required for the next iteration.
Such a strategy could ﬁnd applications in the preparation of
selected polypropionate-type molecules, as already demon-
strated by the synthesis of fragments for ﬁve natural products.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
Representative Procedure for the Synthesis of the α-
Hydroxyallylsilane (1). A 100 mL round-bottom ﬂask equipped
with a magnetic stir bar is sealed with a septum, and allyl alcohol
(1.994 g, 34.4 mmol) is introduced under nitrogen ﬂush. Then, 34 mL
of freshly distilled THF is introduced, and the solution cooled in an
acetone/liquid nitrogen bath at −50 °C. Then, n-BuLi (24 mL, 37.8
mmol) is added with a syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred during
approximately 30 min, warming up to −20 °C. Next, TESCl (5.004 g,
33.2 mmol) is added with a syringe, and the reaction mixture is stirred
overnight, warming up to room temperature. The reaction is
monitored by TLC with a 95:5 pentane/Et2O mixture. The solution
is cooled to −78 °C under nitrogen ﬂush, and then s-BuLi (27 mL,
37.8 mmol) is added dropwise with a syringe pump. After addition, the
reaction mixture is stirred during 45 min, allowing to warm to −60 °C.
The reaction is monitored by TLC with a 95:5 pentane/Et2O mixture.
When the silylated allyl alcohol
is consumed, the cold solution is
transferred via a cannula by nitrogen overpressure in a 500 mL
Erlenmeyer ﬂask containing pentane and a saturated solution of

ammonium chloride at 0 °C under stirring. The pH is constantly
monitored and neutralized when necessary with a HCl 37% solution.
The solution is introduced in a separatory funnel, and the organic layer
is washed 6 times with 100 mL H2O to remove the remaining THF.
The organic layer is dried with MgSO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated at
reduced pressure (40 °C, 700 mbar) and then at high vacuum (2−4
min) to remove the residual hexanes. The product appeared as a
colorless oil (4.950 g, 28.7 mmol, 86%).
General Procedure for the Synthesis of β-Hydroxyacylsi-
lanes (4a−4g/5a−5g). A round-bottom ﬂask or Schlenk tube
equipped with a magnetic stir bar is charged with NiCl2(dppe), and
then sealed with a septum and ﬂushed alternatively with argon or
nitrogen and vacuum. Then, freshly distilled THF is introduced under
argon or nitrogen ﬂush, and the solution is stirred. A fresh lithium
triethylborohydride solution is added via a syringe, and the red
solution turns immediately into a deep seal brown, as a result of
NiHCl(dppe) formation. The solution is stirred at 30 °C during 10
min. A second round-bottom ﬂask is charged with MgBr2 and a
magnetic stir bar, and then dried with a heat gun under high vacuum.
Next, the ﬂask is ﬂushed with nitrogen or argon and the NiHCl(dppe)
solution is introduced via a cannula and cooled to −35 °C with a
chiller under nitrogen or argon ﬂush. Then, the aldehyde and the α-
hydroxyallylsilane as pure material or in solution in THF are added
with a syringe in the solution. The inert gas ﬂush is stopped, and the
reaction is monitored by TLC.

(4a−5a). Following the general procedure described above, a 50 mL
round-bottom ﬂask was charged with 1.297 g (7.04 mmol, 61 mol %)
of MgBr2 and 1.16 mmol (10 mol %) of
freshly prepared
NiHCl(dppe) in 22 mL of THF. The solution was cooled to −35
°C, and then benzaldehyde (1.231 g, 11.6 mmol) and 1 (2.003 g, 11.6
mmol) were introduced into the solution under argon ﬂush. The
solution was stirred at −35 °C for 67 h, and the reaction was

General Procedure for the Esteriﬁcation of β-Hydroxyacyl-
silanes. A round-bottom ﬂask was charged with the β-hydroxyacylsi-
lane, the acid anhydride, and a magnetic stir bar. The round-bottom
ﬂask was sealed with a septum and ﬂushed with nitrogen. Freshly
distilled CH2Cl2 and then NEt3 were added through the septum with a
syringe. DMAP was quickly added to the solution, and then the round-
bottom ﬂask was ﬂushed with nitrogen for 2 min. The nitrogen ﬂush
was then stopped, and the reaction was stirred at room temperature
unless otherwise mentioned. After completion of the reaction, the
solution was quenched with a saturated solution of ammonium
chloride, introduced in a separatory funnel, and the aqueous phase was
extracted twice with CH2Cl2. The combined organic phases were dried
with MgSO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The
crude mixture was puriﬁed by silica gel chromatography.

General Procedure for the Photolysis/Hydrolysis of Pro-
tected β-Hydroxyacylsilanes. The protected β-hydroxyacylsilane
was introduced in a Pyrex round-bottom ﬂask or a Schlenk tube
equipped with a magnetic stir bar. Distilled water was added so that
the substrate concentration was equal to 0.05 M respective to water.
Then, 1−4 equiv in volume of acetone were added until obtaining a
clear solution, and the solution was degassed by the freeze pump thaw
procedure. Degassing showed to be useful as residual oxygen may
cause overoxidation of the aldehyde or the acylsilane. After degassing,
the round-bottom ﬂask or Schlenk tube was covered with a septum
and cooled to −15 °C in an ethanol bath using a chiller unless
otherwise noted. The solution was stirred and enlightened at 365 nm
using a routine UV lamp kept as close as possible from the round-
bottom ﬂask (i.e., <15 cm;
in the Supporting
Information). The reaction was monitored by TLC. In addition, the
reaction progress could be qualitatively evaluated by the disappearance
of the solution luminescence. After completion, the solution was
poured in a separatory funnel, and then brine and Et2O were added
until separation of the organic and aqueous layer. The latter was
extracted three times by Et2O, and then the combined organic phases
were dried with MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo using a rotary
evaporator and then a high vacuum pump (2−3 h) to remove the
trialkylsilanol byproduct. Note: the α-alkoxyaldehydes obtained by this
procedure from the corresponding acylsilanes were not puriﬁed and
were used directly for the next step.

solution was degassed and cooled to −15 °C, and then enlightened at
365 nm under stirring for 24 h at −15 °C. The reaction was monitored

and concentration by reduced pressure, the reaction aﬀorded 17a (305

(±)-7-(4-Methoxybenzyl)oxy-3-hydroxy-2,4-dimethyl-5-(tert-
butyldimethylsilyl)oxy-1-heptan-1,3-diol (37). Following the general
procedure for the photolysis/hydrolysis of protected β-hydroxyacylsi-
lanes, a 10 mL round-bottom ﬂask was charged with 36 (27 mg, 0.050
mmol), H2O (1 mL), freshly distilled THF (4 mL), and a magnetic stir
bar. The solution was degassed and cooled at 0 °C, and the reaction
mixture was then enlightened at 365 nm and stirred for 2 h. The
reaction was monitored by TLC using a 90:10 pentane/acetone
mixture. Once the starting material was consumed, NaBH4 (7 mg,
0.016 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and the reaction was
stirred for 30 min. This second step reaction was monitored by TLC
using an 80:20 pentane/acetone mixture. Then, brine was added, and
the solution was poured in a separatory funnel. The aqueous phase was
extracted three times with Et2O, and the combined organic phases
were dried with MgSO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated under reduced
pressure, aﬀording 24 mg of a crude mixture. The latter was puriﬁed by
chromatography with 3 g of silica gel (pentane/Et2O mixture, 80:20 to
40:60). After puriﬁcation, 15 mg (0.035 mmol, 70% over two steps
pale yellow oil) of 37 (containing around 6−7% of
the minor
diastereoisomer by 1H and 13C NMR) was obtained. 37: 1H NMR

(17) It is known that alkyl acylsilanes exhibit UV absorption around
370 nm. We employed a very simple equipment with a classical UV
lamp (generally used for visualisation of TLC plates), and common
Pyrex glassware. This near visible method was used eﬃciently, even on
gram scale reactions (see the Supporting Information).
