ABSTRACT: A titanocene-mediated intramolecular radical
addition of diﬀerent epoxy vinyl- and allylsulfones has been
achieved. Five- and six-membered ring products were obtained
in good to excellent yields in the presence of both 2.2 and 0.2
equiv of Cp2TiCl. A novel double-activation strategy allowed
us to achieve small-size rings such as cyclobutanes and
cyclopropanes.

■ INTRODUCTION

Intramolecular additions of carbon radicals onto alkenes are
very important reactions in organic synthesis. The eﬃciency of
these reactions depends on their rate, which in turn is subject to
the type of substituents on the radical and on the alkene. Thus,
Michael-type radical conjugate additions,
in which a nucleo-
philic radical is added to an alkene or an alkyne attached to an
electron-withdrawing group (EWG), are among the most
eﬃcient radical cyclizations (Scheme 1).1

Scheme 1. Michael-Type Radical Conjugate Addition

In the early 1980s, several authors explored the synthetic
utility of intramolecular free radical conjugate additions, and
many novel ring systems and natural products have been
obtained using this methodology.1 However, very few examples
of Michael-type radical cyclizations with a vinylsulfone as
acceptor can be found in the literature.2 Among these very few
examples, it is worth mentioning the earlier work of Clive et
al.,2a,b that introduced a new methodology for the synthesis of
spiro-polycyclic compounds based on the intramolecular
addition of a radical, generated with Bu3SnH, to a vinylsulfone.
Further examples of radical cyclization reactions onto vinyl-
sulfones can be found in the review published by Srikanth and
Castle.3

A few examples of titanocene-promoted radical cyclization
reactions have been described in recent years,4 but none of
them involved a vinylsulfone as an acceptor group (Scheme 2).
Therefore, as a complement to our previous work addressing
the intermolecular radical addition of epoxides to vinylsulfones
promoted by titanocene,5 it would be interesting to study the
intramolecular radical coupling of epoxyvinyl- and allylsulfones
mediated by TiIII species.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Here, we designed a study of the above-mentioned titanocene-
promoted intramolecular addition, employing a series of
epoxyvinyl- and allylsulfones as substrates, with the aim of
developing a straightforward procedure for the synthesis of
functionalized cyclic compounds. The results are discussed in
diﬀerent sections depending on the size of the cycle obtained.
<para sub="scope">
5-Exo-Trig Cyclizations. First, we performed the titano-
cene-promoted cyclization of epoxysulfones 1 and 3a/b (see
Table 1), which have similar structures, in order to achieve a 5-
exo-trig cyclization. All reactions were performed using either
overstoichiometric or catalytic quantities of Cp2TiCl. The
results are summarized in Table 1.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
All reactions provided the expected cyclization products in
good to excellent yields, and for both sulfones better yields
were achieved when the experiments were performed with an
excess of the TiIII reagent. All intramolecular additions aﬀorded
the cyclic products as an approximately 50% mixture of two
diastereoisomers. A mechanism for the cyclization reaction of
sulfone 1 is proposed in Scheme 3.
</para>
<para sub=“ques”>
The reaction starts with the well-known homolytic cleavage
of the C−O bond of the oxirane as a result of the TiIII σ-
coordination to the oxygen.7 This epoxide opening regiose-
lectively aﬀords the β-alkoxy radical A, which further proceeds
through the addition to the activated double bond to provide
radical B. The radical cyclization proceeds with a higher rate
than radical A reduction. In the next step, radical B reduces to
the corresponding anion by a second equivalent of titanocene,
yielding intermediate C, which after workup provides the
isolated cyclization products 2a and 2b.
In the catalytic
reaction, titanocene is regenerated by the 2,4,6-trimethylsilyl-
pyridinium chloride present in the reaction media.8

comparison of the spectroscopic data of products with that of similar compounds previously described in the literature.6
<para sub="scope">
For epoxy sulfones 4a/b, however, the formation of 5-exo-trig
cyclization products may not be so straightforward. Previously
reported experimental data9 show that the rate constant for
cyclization reactions of 5-hexenyl radicals with an 5-alkyl
substituent is much lower than the rate constant of those
lacking this substitution. This kind of radical actually prefers the
6-endo-trig cyclization to the 5-exo-trig type, and although
mixtures of both are usually obtained, in most cases the ratio
favors the ﬁrst one by 65 to 35.9 The fact that we obtained the
5-exo cyclization products, 4c/d, not only in high yields but also
as the only products clearly shows that the sulfonyl group
attached to the double bond induces a very strong activating
eﬀect, completely overcoming the presence of the 5-methyl
substituent.

6-Exo-Trig/6-Endo-Trig Cyclizations. We continued our
research by studying the performance of
two new epox-
ysulfones, 5 and 7 (see Table 2), which would provide six-
membered cyclic products after 6-exo and 6-endo cyclizations,
respectively. The reaction conditions and results are
summarized in Table 2.

In the reactions performed with epoxyvinylsulfone 5 (entries
1 and 2 of Table 2), the desired 6-endo cyclization products

the reactions performed with sulfones 1 and 3a/b, the products
were obtained as a mixture of diastereoisomers, although in this
case the trans product was clearly the major product isolated. A

aﬀorded as many as three cyclization products:
the six-
membered ring 8 and the ﬁve-membered rings 4a and 4b
(Scheme 4). The unsaturated alcohol 8 was undoubtedly
formed through a 6-endo-trig cyclization followed by the
elimination of a sulfone group. However,
two diﬀerent
pathways must be considered for the formation of hydrox-
ysulfones 4a and 4b (Scheme 4): a direct 5-exo-trig cyclization
or a two-step process
in which an initial double-bond
conjugation yields a vinylsulfone intermediate, which further
proceeds through a 5-exo-trig cyclization.
</para>
The direct 5-exo-trig cyclization must be excluded. As we
have reported previously,9 cycling processes in which a 5-alkyl-

substituted 5-hexenyl radical is involved show a preference for
6-endo cyclization.4f The two-step process more convincingly
explains the formation of 4a/4b, in which the more activated
vinylsulfone intermediate could be formed readily, and quite
rapidly, by any of the Lewis acids (i.e., titanocene chloride or
zinc chloride) present in the reaction medium. Once this
intermediate has been formed, the reaction proceeds through a
5-exo cyclization process that leads to 4a/4b.

unsaturated (10b) hydroxyvinylsulfones was isolated in both
reactions (see Scheme 5). Lowering the reaction temperature
does not prevent elimination.
</para>
From this result it may concluded that for these model
compounds the 4-exo-trig cyclization is slower
than the
hydrogen elimination process10 and therefore does not occur.
Activation of the sulfonyl group is insuﬃcient for this to
happen.

The synthesis of small-size rings, such as cyclopropanes or
cyclobutanes, has always been a diﬃcult task for chemists.
Synthesizing these compounds using radical procedures
involves the problem of reversibility. That is, the homolytic
opening of
the intermediate cyclic radicals (i.e., cyclo-
propylcarbinyl and cyclobutylcarbinyl) is in both cases faster
than the cyclization of the initial radicals.11 Several strategies
have been applied in titanocene radical chemistry in order to
achieve the synthesis of
three- and four-membered ring
cyclization products successfully.12,4a,f,10a In the past, both our
group4a and that of Gansäuer4f have described the synthesis of
cyclopropanes through a titanocene-mediated Michael-type
intramolecular addition on α,β-unsaturated carbonyl com-
pounds (see Scheme 6). In these examples, the reversibility
of the cyclization reaction can be avoided by trapping the enolic
intermediate radical with TiIII complexes.

closure (Scheme 7).13
<para sub=“opt”>
Based on the previous results described above for ﬁve- and
six-membered rings, we decided to circumvent our cyclization
rate problems through a novel strategy: the double activation of
the β-carbon to the sulfone by the attachment of an ester
moiety as an extra activating group. Accordingly, we performed
the reactions on the double activated epoxysulfone 11a/b with
two diﬀerent amoung of
titanocene reagent: catalytic and
overstoichiometric. Much to our surprise, diﬀerent products
were isolated, depending on the reaction procedure applied
(see Scheme 8).

to explain the formation of 13 requires double-bond isomer-
ization toward the unconjugated position. The force respon-
sible for preventing reversibility in the formation of cyclo-
propylcarbinyl radical 12B from radical 12A is the elimination
of the sulfonyl radical, as depicted in Scheme 9.

initially intended for that purpose, provided us with a three-
membered ring product through a three-step process: double-
bond isomerization, 3-exo-trig cyclization, and sulfone elimi-
nation. Very few examples of the use of a process of fast
elimination of a leaving group placed in the β-position of a
cyclopropylcarbinyl radical for the synthesis of cyclopropanes
can be found in the literature. To our knowledge, in the only
examples described the authors used bromide or phenylthio
leaving groups.16 Therefore,
the example described here
presents a hitherto unprecedented successful 3-exo radical
cyclization procedure.

As a next step, we decided to further study the scope of this

vinylsulfones. With this aim, we made epoxysulfone 16 react

the achievement of

yield when catalytic conditions were applied. The low yield
obtained in the reaction using overstoichiometric Ti(III)
quantities could be explained by competitive hydrogen

Tamdem Reaction. As a ﬁnal point to our cyclization
experiments, we decided to slightly modify the patterns
followed by designing a two-molecule tandem cyclization
experiment.

Based on the information acquired in the previously studied
intra- and intermolecular addition experiments to vinyl- and
allylsulfones, we believed that it might be interesting to perform
a tandem reaction that combined both inter- and intramolecular
consecutive additions, providing a cyclic extrafunctionalized
product. To accomplish this, two molecules were selected. On
one hand, we chose epoxy sulfone 16, which provided us with
the epoxide (radical precursor) and the allylsulfone, intended to
be the secondary acceptor. On the other, phenyl vinylsulfone
19, which aﬀorded the best results in the intermolecular study,5
was selected as the primary acceptor. The reaction was
performed in the presence of 0.2 equiv of TiIII reagent, and
the results are depicted in Scheme 12.

■ CONCLUSIONS

A satisfying procedure for the achievement of several cyclic
hydroxysulfones has been described. The titanocene-mediated
intramolecular addition of diﬀerent epoxy vinyl- and
allylsulfones provided several 3- to 5-membered ring cyclic
products in good to excellent yields. The reaction of 6,7-
epoxyvinylsulfones with titanocene aﬀorded the corresponding
5-exo cyclization products in very good yields as a result of the
very strong activating eﬀect exerted by the sulfone group on the
β-carbon of the double bond. In turn, 7,8-epoxyvinylsulfones
proceed through the desired 6-exo addition, aﬀording the 6-
membered ring products. An example of a 6-endo process
favored by the elimination of a tosyl radical from an epoxy
allylsulfone is described. This result once more conﬁrms the
strong activation eﬀect performed by the sulfone. Also, a novel
double activation procedure has been developed in order to
achieve the synthesis of small-size rings, such as cyclobutanes
and cyclopropanes, from the corresponding 5,6-epoxyvinylsul-
fonyl esters and 5,6-epoxy allylsulfonyl esters. Almost all
reactions described here aﬀorded products in good yields in the
presence of both 2.2 and 0.2 equiv of Cp2TiCl, although
unfortunately, no remarkable diastereoselectivity was observed
in any of the procedures. Finally, an accurate combination of
two reactions with diﬀerent addition rates allowed us to
perform a two-molecule tandem addition which aﬀorded a
highly functionalized ﬁve-membered ring in good yield. The
epoxy vinyl- and allylsulfones reported in this work were
synthesized according to the multistep sequences depicted in
Scheme 14.

for 2 h before use. Sodium used for desiccation was renewed twice
during this 2 h period and once more just before ﬁnal distillation
before use. All titanocene reactions were conducted under a positive
pressure of argon by using standard benchtop techniques for the
handling of air-sensitive materials. Chromatographic separations were
carried out under pressure on silica gel using ﬂash column techniques
on Merck silica gel 60 (0.040−0.063 mm). Unless otherwise
mentioned, yields reported are for chromatographically pure isolated
products.

Titanocene Procedures. General Procedure A (GPA). A mixture
of Cp2TiCl2 (2.20 mmol) and Zn (6.60 mmol) in strictly
deoxygenated THF (11.0 mL) was stirred at room temperature until
the red solution turned green. In a separate ﬂask, the epoxy compound
(1.00 mmol) and the sulfone (1, 2, 5, or 10 mmol) were dissolved in
strictly deoxygenated THF (10.0 mL). The green TiIII solution was
slowly added by cannula to the epoxide solution. After 30 min, an
excess amount of saturated NaH2PO4 was added, and the mixture was
stirred for 2 h. The mixture was ﬁltered to remove insoluble titanium
salts. The product was extracted with diethyl ether (Et2O), and the
combined organic layers were washed with water and brine and dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of the solvent, the crude
product was puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography.

General Procedure B (GPB). A mixture of Cp2TiCl2 (2.20 mmol)
and Zn (6.60 mmol) in strictly deoxygenated THF (11.0 mL) was
stirred at room temperature until the red solution turned green. In a
separate ﬂask, the epoxy compound (1.00 mmol) and the sulfone (1, 2,
5, or 10 mmol) were dissolved in strictly deoxygenated THF (10.0
mL). The epoxide solution was slowly added by cannula to the green
TiIII solution. After 1 h, an excess amount of saturated NaH2PO4 was
added, and the mixture was stirred for 2 h. The mixture was ﬁltered to
remove insoluble titanium salts. The product was extracted with Et2O,
and the combined organic layers were washed with water and brine
and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of the solvent, the
crude product was puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography.

Catalytic Procedure (CP). A mixture of Cp2TiCl2 (0.20 mmol) and
Zn (8.00 mmol) in strictly deoxygenated THF (8.0 mL) was stirred at
room temperature until the red solution turned green. In a separate
ﬂask, the epoxy compound (1.00 mmol), 2,4,6-collidine (8.00 mmol),
and the sulfone (1, 2, 5, or 10 mmol) were dissolved in strictly
deoxygenated THF (0.8 mL). In a separate ﬂask, chlorotrimethylsilane
(TMSCl) (2.5 mmol) was strictly deoxygenated. Next, the epoxide
solution and the TMSCl were slowly added at the same time by
diﬀerent cannulas to the green TiIII solution. After 8 h, an excess
amount of HCl 2 M was added, and the mixture was stirred for 30
min. The layers were separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted
with Et2O. The combined organic layers were washed with water and
brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of the solvent,
the crude product was puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography.

Synthetic Procedures. Compound 1. To a 0 °C solution of 3-
methyl-3-butenol (5.0 g, 58.0 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (20 mL) were added
pyridine (9.4 mL, 116.1 mmol), and methanesulfonyl chloride (7.2
mL, 92.9 mmol). The resultant reaction mixture was stirred at 0 °C
under an argon atmosphere for 1.5 h. After that time, water was added
and the resultant mixture extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined
organic layers were subsequently washed with a 2 M aqueous solution
of HCl, a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3, and brine and dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4. Elimination of
the solvent by careful
distillation of the mixture with a Vigreux column aﬀorded mesylate
21 (9.5 g, 100%). 1H NMR (200 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 1.78 (s, 3H), 2.46

4.88 (s, 1H). Diethyl malonate (13.2 mL, 86.9 mmol) was slowly
added to a suspension of 50% NaH (3.9 g, 81.0 mmol) in THF (124.0
mL), under argon atmosphere and at 0 °C, and the mixture was stirred
at room temperature until the complete formation of the anion (ca. 30
min). A solution of mesylate 21 (9.5 g, 57.9 mmol) in THF (19.0 mL)
was then added dropwise and the new mixture reﬂuxed for 12 h, when
it was cooled to rt, quenched with a 2 M aqueous solution of HCl, and
stirred for 10 min. The aqueous layer was extracted with Et2O, the
mixture of organic extracts was washed with brine and dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed under reduced
pressure, yielding 23.0 g of a mixture of diethyl malonate and the
diester intermediate, which was used without further puriﬁcation in the
next step. In that, the mixture (23.0 g) was dissolved in DMSO (150.0
mL), and anhydrous NaCl (17.7 g, 302.7 mmol) and water (5.4 mL,
302.7 mmol) were added. The reaction vessel was next stirred at 180−
200 °C for 12 h. After this time, the mixture was cooled to rt, diluted

in AcOEt, and subsequently washed several times with water and brine
and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Solvent was then removed under
reduced pressure to yield the monoester 22 (5.2 g, 57%). IR: ν = 2981,

cyclohexane (6.4 mL, 12.82 mmol) was added dropwise to a 0 °C
solution of 4-(methylsulfonyl)toluene (1.09 g, 6.41 mmol) in
anhydrous THF (23.0 mL), and the new mixture was stirred at this
temperature for 30 min. After this time, it was cooled to −78 °C and a
solution of ester 22 (1.00 g, 6.41 mmol) in DMPU (15.0 mL) was
slowly added. This new mixture was stirred at −78 for 6 h, quenched
with a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl, and slowly allowed to
reach rt. The aqueous phase was extracted with AcOEt, and the
combined organic layers were subsequently washed with a 2 M
aqueous solution of HCl, a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3,
and brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Finally, solvent was
removed under reduced pressure and the residue was puriﬁed by ﬂash
chromatography over silica gel (Hex/AcOEt 9:1) to aﬀord 22 (191

NaBH4 (35 mg, 0.92 mmol) was added to a solution of keto sulfone
23 (216 mg, 077 mmol) in MeOH (3.8 mL), and the mixture was
stirred under argon atmosphere at rt for 15 min. It was then quenched
with acetone and stirred, and all solvents were removed at reduced
pressure to yield a residue that was diluted in Et2O and brine. The
aqueous phase was extracted with Et2O, the combined organic layers
washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and solvent was
removed under reduced pressure, aﬀording a residue identiﬁed as

acetate 28 (6.5 g, 57.0 mmol), in THF (88.0 mL) at 0 °C, were added
triphenylphosphine (1.34 g, 5.13 mmol) andPd(PPh3)4 (132 mg,
0.114 mmol), and this mixture was reﬂuxed under argon atmosphere
for 1 h. In the meantime, diethyl malonate (30.3 mL, 199.5 mmol) was
slowly added to a suspension of 60% NaH (8.7 g, 182.4 mmol) in
anhydrous THF (250 mL), under argon atmosphere at 0 °C, and the
mixture was stirred at room temperature until complete formation of
the anion (ca. 30 min). Once both solutions (Suzuki’s reagent and
malonate anion) were prepared, the malonate anion was slowly added
over the Suzuki’s reagent solution, avoiding both air and moisture, and
the new mixture was reﬂuxed for 24 h and then allowed to reach rt. In
that moment, a 2 M aqueous solution of HCl was added, and the
aqueous layer was extracted with AcOEt. The mixture of organic
extracts was washed with an aqueous saturated solution of Na2CO3
and brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was
distilled away, yielding 40.5 g of a mixture of diethyl malonate and the
diester intermediate, which was used without further puriﬁcation in the
next step. In that step, the mixture (40.5 g) was dissolved in DMSO
(100.0 mL), and anhydrous NaCl (40.7 g, 696 mmol) and water (12.5
mL, 696 mmol) were added. The reaction vessel was next stirred at
180−200 °C for 48 h. After this time, the mixture was cooled to rt,
diluted in AcOEt, subsequently washed several times with water and
brine, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Solvent was then carefully
removed by distillation, and monoester 29 (8.1 g, 99%) was aﬀorded.

Compound 7. A 2 M solution of BuLi in cyclohexane (2.4 mL, 4.75
mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of
the trimethylsilyl
derivative 2617 (1.08 g, 4.75 mmol) in completely anhydrous and
deoxygenated DME (23.7 mL) at −70 °C, and the resultant mixture
was stirred under argon atmosphere at −70 °C for 30 min. At this
point, a previously prepared deoxygenated solution of 6-methyl-5-
hepten-2-one (300 mg, 2.38 mmol) in anhydrous DME (2.4 mL) was
carefully added dropwise to the mixture, and once the addition was
ﬁnished the reaction was allowed to reach rt for 48 h and then
quenched with a saturated aqueous solution of NH4Cl. The new
mixture was then stirred for further 15 min, the layers were separated,
and the aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2. The combined
organic layers were washed with brine and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4, and solvent was removed at reduced pressure. The crude
product was puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography (Hex/AcOEt 9:1) to

Compounds 18a/b. To a stirred solution of 14a/b (50 mg, 0.17
mmol) in deoxygenated THF (3 mL) was added collidine (166 mg,
1.36 mmol) and the mixture stirred at rt under argon atmosphere for
24 h, when it was quenched with a 2 M aqueous solution of HCl. The
new mixture was further stirred for 15 min, the aqueous layer was
extracted with Et2O, the combined organic extracts were washed with
brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure to yield the isomerized product 15 (49 mg,
98%). A mixture of 15 (315 mg, 1.07 mmol), NaHCO3 (198 mg, 2.36
mmol), and m-CPBA (370 mg, 2.14 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10.0 mL) was
stirred at rt for 12 h and then was quenched with a 10% aqueous
solution of Na2S2O3. The new mixture was further stirred for 30 min,
the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2, the combined organic
extracts were washed with a saturated aqueous solution of NaHCO3
and brine, and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure. Puriﬁcation of the residue by ﬂash
chromatography over silica gel (Hex/AcOEt 8:2) aﬀorded epoxy
