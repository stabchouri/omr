ABSTRACT: Four series of C7N aminocyclitol analogues of glucose
were synthesized by stereocontrolled epoxide opening of hydroxyl
protected forms of the cyclohexane epoxides cyclophellitol and 1,6-
epi-cyclophellitol. The resulting hydroxymethyl substituted amino-
cyclitols were tested as glycosidase inhibitors. Cyclitols having an
amino group in an α conﬁguration at a position equivalent to the
anomeric in the sugar were found to be low micromolar inhibitors of
the α-glucosidase from baker’s yeast with Ki
’s near to 2 μM. On the
other hand, N-octyl aminocyclitols having the nitrogen substituents in
an α or β conﬁguration were found to be good inhibitors of recombinant β-glucocerebrosidase with Ki values between 8.3 and 17
μM, and also inhibited lysosomal β-glucosidase activity in live cells at low-micromolar concentrations. A computational docking
study suggests a diﬀerential binding among the diﬀerent series of β-glucocerebrosidase inhibitors. In agreement with the
experimental results, the binding poses obtained indicate that the presence of an alkyl lipid substituent in the inhibitor mimicking
one of the lipid chains in the substrate is critical for potency. In contrast, the matching of hydroxymethyl substituents in the
aminocyclitols and the parent glucosylceramide does not seem to be strictly necessary for potent inhibition, indicating the risk of
simplifying structural analogies in sugar mimetic design.

■ INTRODUCTION

Glycosidases are involved in a large range of
important
biological processes. These enzymes are attractive targets for
the design of therapies for numerous diseases such as diabetes,
lysosomal storage disorders, and cancer.1

Therefore, glycosidase inhibitors are currently of great interest
as promising candidates for new drug development.

Aminocyclitols, which have been demonstrated as eﬀective
mimics of natural carbohydrates, are amino polyhydroxy
cycloalkanes and comprise an important group of compounds
for drug development. The amino functionality can modulate
biological activity with respect to the parent carbohydrate, and
the replacement of the endocyclic oxygen confers hydrolytic
stability.2−4 Diﬀerent families of aminocyclitol analogues have
been synthesized over the last decades, and their biological
activities have been studied. These include the C7N amino-
cyclitols,2 polyhydroxylated aminocyclohexanes with an exocy-
clic methyl or hydroxymethyl substituent. C7N compounds
have found applications in medicinal chemistry as antifungal
agents, such as salbostatin,5 and antibiotics, such as validamycin
A,6 the most active of the validamycin family, which contain a
valienamine4 unit, linked to either validamine, valiolamine, or
hydroxyvalidamine7 (Figure 1).

Other C7N aminocyclitols such as voglibose,8 a derivative of
valiolamine,9 or acarbose10 are α-glucosidase inhibitors used to
treat type II diabetes. C7N aminocyclitols have therapeutic
potential for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders, such
as 4-epi-N-octyl-β-valienamine for GM1-gangliosidosis or N-
octyl-β-valienamine for Gaucher disease.11

Over the past decade, applications of some N-alkylated
aminocyclitols as β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) inhibitors with
therapeutic potential
for Gaucher disease have been
described.12−17 In this context, we reported on a series of
inosamine derivatives (scyllo- and chiro-aminocyclitols, Figure
1), as selective inhibitors of GCase.12,13 In continuation of our
eﬀorts in the design and synthesis of new glycosidase inhibitors,
we became interested in four series of C7N aminocyclitols (1−
4, Figure 2) to study their glycosidase inhibitory activities.
These compounds were designed taking into account
the
transformation of
chiro-amino-
cyclitols previously reported12,13 to the C7N aminocyclitols by
replacing a hydroxyl group by hydroxymethyl substituents

Trost’s original procedure,21,24 which consisted of the in situ
the catalyst precursor, bis(π-allyl)-palladium
preparation of
dichloride, by reacting allyltrimethylsilane and PdCl2(CH3CN)2
in acetonitrile.25 These conditions gave more reproducible
results and eliminated the problems associated with the
manipulation of the palladium sensitive compound. Therefore,
tetraacetate (±)-8 was subjected to palladium-catalyzed kinetic
resolution using chiral phosphine ligand (R,R)-10. Under these
conditions, the (−)-enantiomer of 8 was converted to pivalate
(−)-9,21,24 whereas the (+)-enantiomer of
the tetraacetate

(−)-9 in the presence of the pivalate was performed using
methanolic ammonia to give triol (−)-11.21,24 Unfortunately,
the clean protection of the triol (−)-11 as a benzyl ether21,24
was not possible at our work scale due to the lability of the
pivalate group under the conditions described for this reaction.
Therefore, we decided to use the methoxymethyl ether
(MOM) group instead of benzyl ether as hydroxyl protecting
group. With this modiﬁcation,
reaction proceeded
uneventfully to give (−)-12,
the
pivalate ester to alcohol (−)-13, which was converted to its
corresponding stannylmethyl ether (−)-14 (Scheme 1).
Intermediate (−)-14 was used as precursor
for a 2,3-
sigmatropic rearrangement, which was accomplished by
treatment with 1.5 equiv of n-BuLi at −78 °C for 5 min to
put
the hydroxylmethyl group in place with regio- and

substrate glucosylceramide (A), and aminocyclitols 1b (B), 2b (C), and 3b/4b (superposed in yellow and green, respectively) (D). Panel A shows
the carboxylate of residue E235 in its protonated form, which is postulated as the acid catalyst that protonates the ceramide hydroxyl group, once the
scissile ketal bond is cleaved. Panels B−D, on the contrary, show the aminocyclitols bound to the E235 unprotonated form of the enzyme. This was
based on the assumption that the presence of a charged amino group (expected at pH 5.2) in these ligands, at close distance from the carboxylate of
E235, would stabilize the anionic form of the amino acid, as has been observed in the crystal structure of the isofagomine-bound GCase.44

Computational Docking. To shed further light on the
binding mode of the compounds that showed inhibition of
imiglucerase, computational docking against known structures
of GCase43,44 was carried out. For comparison purposes, a
truncated model of the natural substrate GlcCer was also
docked against the target enzyme.
</para>
<para sub=“comp”>
Figure 6A shows the best docked pose obtained for GlcCer
bound in a plausible prereactive conformation, where the
anomeric carbon lies at 3.6 Å of the carboxylate of the essential
nucleophile residue E340 and the oxygen of the scissile ketal
bond accepts a hydrogen bond from the protonated catalytic
residue E235. In this conformation, the hydroxymethyl group
of GlcCer is disposed, donating a hydrogen bond to the
carbonyl oxygen of the amide group of residue N396 and
accepting another one from a crystallographic water, which is
also hydrogen bonded to N396 and S345. In contrast, the best
pose for 1b shows its cyclohexyl moiety in an inverted
conformation relative to GlcCer,
in which the C6-hydrox-
ymethyl group is oriented toward the opposite side of the
catalytic cavity, forming hydrogen bonds with residues N234
and E340 (Figure 6B). This is due to the steric requirements of
the axial octylamino substituent, which precludes binding in a
GlcCer-like manner. Compound 2b shows a similar orientation

to 1b, although,
in this case, the determined binding pose
suggests that the polar interactions between the charged amino
group of the ligand and the E235 carboxylate are the main
determinants of this orientation (Figure 6C). On the contrary,
compounds 3b and 4b show binding poses with their
cyclohexyl moieties disposed in a more GlcCer-like orientation,
with the corresponding hydroxymethyl substituents interacting
with residue N396 (Figure 6D). Noteworthy,
these two
compounds were the best GCase inhibitors found in this
study. Comparison with the predicted binding modes for the
parent C6N analogues chiro-C8 and scyllo-C8 (Figure 2) reveals
some similarities (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The
best pose obtained for
the chiro-conﬁgured compound
resembles those of compounds 1b and 3b, while the best
pose for the scyllo-C8 analogue resembles those of 2b and 4b.
Thus, replacement of a hydroxyl
in the parent chiro-C8 or
scyllo-C8 by a hydroxymethyl group did not result in large
diﬀerences in the ways of interaction with the target enzyme
and most of the hydrogen bonds with the receptor (i.e., with
residues D127, W179, or N234) are maintained in all the
compounds. Similarly, the hydrophobic interactions between
the axial alkyl substituent of compounds 1b, 3b, or chiro-C8 and
residues L241, Y244, P245, and F246, as well as those between
the equatorial alkyl chain of compounds 2b, 4b, or scyllo-C8
and residues Y313, L314, and K346, are mostly maintained.

The presence of both axial and equatorial amino groups among
the imiglucerase active inhibitors group is somewhat surprising,
since the mimetism of the anomeric β-oxygen of GluCer with
the nitrogen atom in the aminocyclitol inhibitor was initially
believed to play a critical role on inhibitor potency.45 The
results of the docking of those inhibitors having equatorial
amino groups (2b, 4b, or scyllo-C8) show that this is the case
and hydrogen bonding of the nitrogen and the catalytic acid
E235 is obtained. The lipidic chain in this series would be
located in the same pocket where the sphingosine chain of the
ceramide substrate is
the axial alkylamino
compounds, 1b, 3b, or
chiro-C8, no hydrogen bonding
interaction of the nitrogen with residues of the active site is
observed. In this case, the six-membered ring is found rotated
about 60°, placing the N-alkyl chain in the pocket where the
alkyl fatty acid group of the GluCer substrate is found; this
hydrophobic interaction would account for the unexpected
recognition of the axial aminocyclitols in the imiglucerase active
site, which is believed to be dominated by the lipidic
interactions, as shown for the importance of the alkyl length
in the inhibitory potency. The presence of two long alkyl chains
in the GluCer substrate would facilitate the duality of axial and
equatorial structures in the N-alkyl active inhibitors found. The
these compounds are
binding modes
compatible with a competitive mechanism of
inhibition;
however, analysis of the inhibition mode showed that some
of them (1b and 4b) exhibit a mixed mechanism. This suggests
that there could be alternative binding modes in addition to
those predicted by these docking studies.

<para sub=“comp”>
In this sense,

it is worth mentioning that, among all the
crystal structures reported for human GCase, several of them
(PDB codes 2NSX,44 2J25,46 2WKL,47 2XWE,48 3GXI,49
3GXM,49 and 3RIL50) present a narrow groove between
loops L1 (residues 341−350) and L3 (residues 312−319), two
of the loops that conform the entrance to the enzyme active
site.43,51 We and others have previously proposed that this
groove, which is not accessible in other GCase structures
(Figure 7), could be occupied by one of the alkyl chains of
glucosylceramide or by the hydrophobic moieties of some
inhibitors bound into the active center of GCase.14,44,51 Using
structure 2NSX as a target for docking of the C7N GCase
inhibitors, we observed that, in addition to the detection of
poses in the active site cavity, which were similar to those
shown in Figure 6 (results not shown), poses with the

aminocyclitol moieties bound into that adjacent groove were
also detected (Figure S3, Supporting Information). This is
illustrated in Figure 7B for compounds 3b and 4b. Although
binding of inhibitors at this site might not have as large an eﬀect
as direct binding at the active site of GCase, it is tempting to
propose that this could be an alternative site for modulation of
the GCase activity, particularly if part of the inhibitor projects
toward the entrance to the active site, as it is shown for
compound 4b in Figure 7B. Binding in an opposite orientation,
as that shown for 3b, could have a lower eﬀect, although it
would still hamper the binding of any substrate moiety in that
location. It is well-known that occurrence of diﬀerent binding
modes like these could translate into mixed-type inhibition
properties.52 Thus,
reasonable to propose that
inhibitors such as aminocyclitols C7N could explore these
diﬀerent binding modes, and that the relative populations of
each one would determine their behavior as purely competitive,
mixed-type, or other type of inhibition.

■ CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have developed a strategy for the synthesis of
four series of C7N aminocyclitols from cyclohexane epoxides
(+)-5 and (+)-6 by stereocontrolled ring opening with nitrogen
nucleophiles. The ﬁnal compounds have been tested as α-
glycosidase and recombinant GCase inhibitors, and other
glycosidases. Activity data reﬂect that the conﬁgurations of
amino groups and hydroxyl groups have an important eﬀect on
series of C7N
glycosidase inhibition. Among the four
aminocyclitols, N-alkyl aminocyclitols 1a and 1b were found
to be low micromolar inhibitors of baker’s yeast α-glucosidase
with Ki values of 2.1 and 1.9 μM, respectively. Furthermore, N-
octyl compounds 1b, 3b, and 4b were the most potent
recombinant GCase inhibitors of the series of hydroxymethy-
laminocyclitols described in this work with Ki values between
8.3 and 17 μM. The presence of both axial and equatorial
alkylamino groups among this group is somewhat surprising,
since the mimetism of the anomeric β-oxygen of GluCer by the
nitrogen atom was initially believed to exert a critical inﬂuence
on inhibitor potency. The docking studies suggest that the
presence of a lipidic chain is a main structural determinant for
high potency and some inhibitors having an axial alkylamino
substituent have also favorable interactions with several residues
in the active site that would account for its inhibitory potency.
These results show that design of glycoanalogues based on

simple structural correlations involving hydroxyl matching or
anomeric conﬁguration with the sugar substrates is not as direct
as one could expect, and that other less evident eﬀects need
also to be considered. The N-octyl substituted most active
compounds (1b, 3b, and 4b) also behaved as inhibitors of
lysosomal β-glucosidase in intact wild-type human ﬁbroblasts at
low-micromolar concentrations, showing a good permeability
and stability under cell culture conditions. This is a positive
trend for their potential use as pharmacological chaperones,17,53
as the activity shown in isolated enzyme is maintained in live
cells.

0.13 mmol) was dissolved in THF (3 mL) and Pd/C (50 mg, 5−15%
Pd on activated C, water-wet) was then added. The ﬂask was
repeatedly ﬁlled and evacuated with hydrogen and vigorously stirred at
room temperature for 14 h under H2 (1 atm). The reaction mixture
was next ﬁltered through a plug of Celite to separate the catalyst, and
the ﬁlter was washed three times with MeOH. The combined ﬁltrates

General Method A: Reaction of epoxides 5 and 6 with
nucleophiles in the presence of LiClO4. A 2 N suspension of
LiClO4 in anhydrous CH3CN (3 mL) was added dropwise under an
argon atmosphere to the starting epoxides 5 or 6 (0.3 mmol). NaN3 or
the corresponding amine (3.0 mmol) was added next, and the reaction
mixture was stirred at 80 °C. After 18 h, the mixture was cooled to rt,
quenched by the addition of H2O (0.5 mL) and concentrated in vacuo.
The residue was taken up in 30 mL of Et2O and washed with H2O (15
mL), and the aqueous layer was extracted with Et2O (3 × 30 mL). The
combined organic layers were washed with brine and dried over
MgSO4. Filtration and evaporation aﬀorded crude aminoalcohols,
which were puriﬁed as indicated below.

General Method D: Synthesis of Amino Alcohols 1, 2, 4a−
c,d, and 3d by Debenzylation with BCl3. A solution of the
corresponding amine (0.21 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (10 mL) at
−78 °C was treated with 1 M BCl3 in heptane (2.5 equiv for OBn
group). The reaction mixture was allowed to rt and stirred for an
additional 16 h. The mixture was then cooled to −78 °C and
quenched with MeOH (0.5 mL). Solvents were then removed under
reduced pressure, and EtOAc (3 mL) was added next to the oily
residue. After sonication in an ultrasonic bath for 1 min, the suspended
solid was collected by ﬁltration and dried at vacuum. Following this
protocol, 1, 2, 4, and 3d were obtained as the corresponding
hydrochloride salts.

General Method E: Synthesis of Amino Alcohols 3a−3c by
Hydrogenolysis Using Pd/C Catalyst. In a glass pressure ﬂask, the
benzylated amino alcohol (0.1 mmol) was dissolved in a mixture of
THF (3 mL) and concentrated HCl (4 drops). Pd/C (50 mg, 5−15%
Pd on activated C, water-wet) was then added. The ﬂask was
repeatedly ﬁlled and evacuated with hydrogen and vigorously stirred at

was ﬁltered through a plug of Celite to separate the catalyst, and the
ﬁlter was washed three times with MeOH. The ﬁltrate and combined
washings were concentrated to give the required amino alcohols.

Biological Assays. The glycosidases α-glucosidase (from baker’s
yeast and rice), β-glucosidase (from crude almond), β-galactosidase
(from bovine liver), and α-galactosidase (from green coﬀee beans) that
were used in the inhibition studies, as well as 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-
glucoside and the corresponding p-nitrophenyl glycoside substrates,
were purchased from Sigma. Imiglucerase (Cerezyme; recombinant
human GCase analogue) was kindly provided by Genzyme.

General Procedure for

the Inhibition Assay against
Commercial Enzymes.13 Commercial glycosidase solutions were
prepared with the appropriated buﬀer and incubated in 96-well plates
at 37 °C without (control) or with inhibitor for 5 min. After addition
of the corresponding substrate solution, incubations were prolonged
for diﬀerent time periods: 3 min for β-glucosidase (from almond) and
α-glucosidase (from baker’s yeast), 5 min for β-galactosidase, 10 min
for α-glucosidase (from rice), and 13 min for α-galactosidase and
stopped by addition of Tris solution (50 μL, 1 M) or Na2CO3 (180
μL, 1 M), depending on the enzymatic inhibition assay. The amount of
p-nitrophenol formed was determined at 405 nm with a Spectramax
M5 (Molecular Devices Corporation) spectrophotometer. For α-
glucosidase (from rice),
the activity was determined with p-
nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (1 mM) in sodium acetate buﬀer
(50 mM, pH 5.0). For α-glucosidase (from baker’yeast), the activity
was determined with p-nitrophenyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (1 mM) in
sodium phosphate buﬀer (100 mM, pH 7.2). For β-glucosidase (from
the activity was determined with p-nitrophenyl-β-D-
almond),
glucopyranoside (1 mM) in sodium acetate buﬀer (100 mM, pH

5.0). β-Galactosidase activity was determined with p-nitrophenyl-β-D-
galactopyranoside (1 mM) in sodium phosphate buﬀer (100 mM, 0.1
mM MgCl2, pH 7.2). α-Galactosidase activity was determined with p-
nitrophenyl-α-D-galactopyranoside (1 mM) in sodium phosphate
buﬀer (100 mM, pH 6.8). The commercial glycosidase solutions
were prepared as follows: α-glucosidase (from rice): (NH4)2SO4
suspension (30 μL) in buﬀer (1.8 mL); α-glucosidase (from baker’s
yeast): (0.1 mg mL−1 buﬀer); β-glucosidase (from crude almond): (0.1
mg mL−1 buﬀer); β-galactosidase from bovine liver (0.5 mg mL−1
buﬀer); α-galactosidase (from green coﬀee beans): 7.4 μL in buﬀer
(1.99 mL).

Glucosylceramide Synthase Assay.54 A549 Cells were washed
with sodium phosphate (PBS) (10 mM, 137 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and
collected by brief trypsinization. The cells were then washed twice with
PBS and resuspended in 50 mM TRIS-HCl buﬀer (pH 7.4) and 10
mM MgCl2 by sonication (three times, 30 s). The cell lysate (100 μL)
was incubated with inhibitor (0.25 mM ﬁnal concentration) for 10 min
at 37 °C. Then, 25 μL of NAD (16 mM in TRIS-HCl, pH 7.4 and 10
mM MgCl2), 25 μL of UDP-Glucose (2 mM in TRIS-HCl 50 mM, pH
7.4 and 10 mM MgCl2), and 52 μL of NBD C6-ceramide complexed to
BSA at a 1:1 ratio (20 μM in 50 mM TRIS-HCl buﬀer, pH = 7.4, 10
mM MgCl2)) were added. After 15 min incubation at 37 °C, the
reactions were stopped by adding 800 μL of MeOH and centrifuged at
10 000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was transferred to HPLC vials.
HPLC analyses were performed with a Waters 2690 Alliance System
coupled to a Waters 2475 Fluorescence detector (Milford, MA) using
a C18-Kromasil column and eluted with 15% H2O and 85% CH3CN,
both with a 0.1% of triﬂuoroacetic acid, ﬂowing at 1 mL/min. The
detector was set at an excitation wavelength of 465 nm and measured
the emission wavelength at 530 nm. Empower Software (Waters
Corporation) was utilized for data acquisition and processing.

Imiglucerase Inhibition Assay. Imiglucerase (Genzyme) activity
was determined with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyranoside as
previously reported.13 Brieﬂy, enzyme solutions (25 μL from a stock
solution containing 0.1 mg mL−1) in the presence of 0.25% (w/v)
sodium taurocholate and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in McIlvaine buﬀer
(100 mM sodium citrate and 200 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer, pH
5.2) were incubated at 37 °C without (control) or with inhibitor at a
ﬁnal volume of 40 μL for 30 min. After addition of 60 μL of substrate
(4 mM, McIlvaine buﬀer, pH 5.2), the samples were incubated at 37
°C for 10 min. Enzymatic reactions were stopped by the addition of
aliquots (150 μL) of glycine/NaOH buﬀer (100 mM, pH 10.6). The
amount of 4-methylumbelliferone formed was determined with a
SpectraMax M5 ﬂuorometer (Molecular Devices Corporation) at 355
nm (excitation) and 460 nm (emission).

IC50 values were determined by plotting percent activity versus log
[I], using at least ﬁve diﬀerent inhibitor concentrations. The type of
inhibition and Ki values for more active inhibitors were determined by
Lineweaver−Burk or Dixon plots of assays performed with diﬀerent
concentrations of inhibitor and substrate.

Cell Lines and Culture. Wild-type ﬁbroblasts were obtained from
Eucellbank (University of Barcelona). Fibroblast cells were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 100
U mL−1 of penicillin, and 100 μg mL−1 of streptomycin at 37 °C in 5%
CO2. Culture medium was replaced every 3−4 days, and all cells used
in this study were between the 14th and 30th passages.
Cytotoxicity Assay in Wild-Type Human Fibroblasts.54 Wild-
type ﬁbroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM; D5796; Sigma-aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin−streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2/
95% air. Cells used were between the 14th and 30th passage. At the
time of the experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 25 000 cells
per well
in 96-well plates. Media were renewed after 24 h, and
compounds were added to give ﬁnal concentrations of 300−18 μM.
All compounds were dissolved in DMSO, and control experiments
were performed with DMSO. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5%
CO2 for 24 h. Then, the media were replaced with 100 μL of 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) solu-
tion, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 3 h at 37 °C in

5% CO2/95% air. The number of viable cells was quantiﬁed by the
estimation of its dehydrogenase activity, which reduces MTT to water-
insoluble formazan, which was dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO and
measured at 570 nm with a SpectraMax M5 (Molecular Devices

Inhibition Assay of Human Lysosomal Glycosidases.54,55
Fibroblasts were seeded at a density of 105 cells per well in 24-well
plates. After 24 h, the media were replaced with fresh media with or
without a test compound and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 24 h.
The enzyme activity assay was performed after removing media
supplemented with the corresponding compound. The monolayers
were washed with 100 μL of PBS solution. Then, 80 μL of PBS and 80
μL of 200 mM acetate buﬀer (pH 4.0) were added to each well. The
reactions were started by the addition of 100 μL of substrates (200
mM acetate buﬀer, pH 4.0) to each well, followed by incubation at 37
°C for 2 h. The substrates were 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-D-glucopyrano-
for lysosomal human β-glucosidase) and 4-methyl-
side (5 mM,
for lysosomal human α-
umbelliferyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (5 mM,
glucosidase). Enzymatic reactions were stopped by lysing the cells with
1.8 mL of glycine/NaOH buﬀer (100 mM, pH 10.6). Liberated 4-
methylumbelliferone was measured (excitation 355 nm, emission 460
nm) with a SpectraMax M5 ﬂuorometer (Molecular Devices
Corporation) in 24-well format. All determinations were performed
in triplicate. Cells used were between the 14th and 30th passages.
Computational Methods. Protein complexes were modeled with
the package Schrödinger Suite 2014,56 through its graphical interface
Maestro.57 The program MacroModel58 with its default force ﬁeld
OPLS 2005,59 a modiﬁed version of the OPLS-AA force ﬁeld, and GB/
SA water solvation conditions60 were used for all energy calculations.
Coordinates of GCase (PDB codes 2V3E43 and 2NSX44) were
obtained from the Protein Data Bank61 at Brookhaven National
Laboratory. The program Glide62 was used for
the docking
calculations using the default XP precision settings except
for a
setting of 500 000 poses per ligand for the initial phase of docking, a
scoring window of 200 for keeping initial poses, and a limit of 1000
poses per ligand for energy minimization.
