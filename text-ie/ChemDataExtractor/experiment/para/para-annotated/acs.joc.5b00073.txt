ABSTRACT: A highly eﬃcient nonenzymatic kinetic resolution of a series of structurally diverse racemic α-methylene-β-
hydroxy esters utilizing the acyl transfer catalyst An-PIQ and propionic anhydride is reported. This procedure provides recovered
alcohols with extremely high ee’s (up to >99%) in reasonable conversions and excellent selectivity factors (S up to 108). Several
synthetically important substrates were resolved in gram-scale reactions, and highly optically pure α-methylene-β-hydroxy esters
were obtained with excellent S values and good yields.

■ INTRODUCTION

Kinetic resolution (KR) via nucleophilic acyl transfer catalysis is
one of the most powerful and eﬃcient strategies to obtain
optically pure compounds.1 Since the pioneering work of
Vedejs2a,b and Fu2c−e on the nonenzymatic KR of secondary
alcohols, using chiral phosphine and chiral 4-dimethylamino-
pyridine (DMAP) analogues as catalysts, respectively, asym-
metric nucleophilic acyl transfer catalysis for the KR of a variety
of secondary alcohols has been further developed.3 It is worth
noting that the amidine-based nucleophilic catalysts reported by
Birman,4 such as CF3-PIP,4a Cl-PIQ,4b BTM,4c and HBTM,4d,e
exhibited excellent tolerance to substrate scope, which can be
attributed to π−π and π−cation interactions between the sp2
functional groups of
the substrates and acylated catalysts,
aﬀording high selectivity factors. Through combination of the
key features of both Fu’s and Birman’s catalysts, a new variant
of nucleophilic catalyst has been designed, Fc-PIP,5a for the KR
of arylalkyl carbinols (S up to >1800) in our group. Although
much eﬀort has been devoted to the development of
nonenzymatic catalysts for the KR of a variety of secondary
alcohols,4f,6 to the best of our knowledge, their application for
the KR of α-methylene-β-hydroxy esters (Morita−Baylis−
Hillman adducts, MBH adducts) by acylation has received
much less attention. In 2007 Connon7 reported the only
example of nonenzymatic acylative KR of MBH adducts
derived from aromatic aldehydes. However, very low selectivity
(S = 13) was obtained, probably due to the intrinsic ﬂaw of two
sp2-hybridized substituents. More than that, a
planar
nucleophilic nonenzymatic acylative KR of aliphatic aldehyde-
derived MBH adducts is unknown; thus, a great challenge still
remains.

MBH adducts are densely functionalized molecules (e.g.,
MBH-1 or MBH-2) and consequently are highly versatile chiral

building blocks,8,9 which have been widely employed for the
synthesis of
important optically pure natural products and
bioactive compounds (Figure 1). Therefore, much eﬀort has
been devoted to develop a highly eﬃcient asymmetric MBH
reaction for the preparation of optically pure or enantioen-
riched α-methylene-β-hydroxy esters.10,11 Notably, Hatakeya-
ma11a developed a highly enantioselective MBH reaction of
aldehydes using β-isocupreidine (β-ICD) as the chiral amine

catalyst, and hexaﬂuoroisopropyl acrylate (HFIPA) as the
activated alkene, and aﬀorded the corresponding MBH adducts
the eﬃcient β-ICD−HFIPA
in up to 99% ee. However,
protocol still suﬀers from the formation of a large quantity of
dioxanone byproducts, especially when aliphatic aldehydes are
used as electrophiles.

We recently synthesized a highly eﬃcient nucleophilic
catalyst An-PIQ5b for the KR of arylalkyl carbinols, with
excellent selectivity factors (up to 530). Considering the
current diﬃculties in the preparation of optically pure α-
methylene-β-hydroxy esters, we set out
to design suitable
substrates and apply our developed catalysts in the KR of
racemic MBH adducts, derived from aliphatic aldehydes and
acrylates. However, several challenges are associated with this
procedure: (1) the choice of the suitable ester group, (2) the
relationship between individual π−π interaction of the alkene
and carbonyl group with the acylated catalyst, and (3) the role
of An-PIQ structure and whether it is decisive for the selectivity
factor. In order to address these issues and surmount the
diﬃculties in preparation of optically pure α-methylene-β-
hydroxy esters, a series of PIQ analogues and MBH adducts
were synthesized to test the feasibility.

Herein, we report a highly eﬃcient nonenzymatic KR of
racemic α-methylene-β-hydroxy esters utilizing the acyl transfer
catalyst An-PIQ. This protocol provides recovered alcohols
with extremely high ee values (≥99%) and in reasonable
conversions and good-excellent selectivity factors (S up to 108).
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
Initially, rac-1a was used as the substrate to test the feasibility of
the KR with Fc-PIP5a as the nucelophilic catalyst, which is a
useful catalyst for the KR of arylalkyl carbinols. The reaction
proceeded tediously when isobutyric anhydride was used as the
acylating agent in diisopropyl ether at room temperature for 12
h, providing unreacted (R)-alcohol (yield: 38%; ee: 84.2%),
(S)-acylated product 2a (yield: 44%; ee not determined), and
small quantities (15% yield) of byproduct 3 (Scheme 1). It is
obvious that benzyl ester 1a is not stable enough in the
presence of Fc-PIP.

<para sub=“opt”>
In order to solve this problem, benzhydryl ester 1b was used
instead of 1a. To our delight, the reaction proceeded much
smoothly and provided unreacted 1b and acylated 2b in 43.7%

ee and 83.1% ee, respectively, with a slightly higher selectivity
factor (S = 17) compared with Connon’s7 report. Encouraged
by this result, rac-1b was then chosen as the model substrate to
investigate the catalytic asymmetric KR capability of diﬀerent
nucleophilic catalysts (Figure 2).4b,5 As shown in Table 1, it was
surprising that our newly developed catalyst An-PIQ gave the
optimal selectivity factor (S = 38) (Table 1, entry 2), whereas
other catalysts such as Cl-PIQ displayed lower S values (Table
1, entries 3−5). The selectivity factor S = 38 given by An-PIQ is
already the best result in the nonenzymatic KR of a MBH
adduct, and this exhibits potential practical utility for the
synthesis of optically pure MBH adducts, which prompted us to
further optimize the reaction system.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
Screening solvents (Table 2, entries 1, 4−11) revealed that
diisopropyl ether (S = 56) gave, in general, an S value higher
than that of other solvents. Nevertheless, toluene and other
ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and
cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME)) showed similar selectivities
(entries 4, 5, 6, 9) to those of diisopropyl ether. Our screening
of anhydrides revealed that propionic anhydride was optimal,
aﬀording an excellent selectivity factor S = 89 (entries 12 vs 1,
13). An increase in the substrate concentration, to 0.4 M, was
found to be detrimental to the selectivity factor (entries 2 and
3). We then examined the eﬀect of bases on the selectivity
factor of the KR and found that potasium carbonate gave the
optimal result, whereas Et3N, DIPEA (N,N-diisopropylethyl-
amine), and 2,6-lutidine were found to be slightly inferior to
potassium carbonate in terms of both stereoselectivities and
conversions (entries 15 vs 12, 14, 16).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Optimization of solvents, anhydrides, bases, and concen-
trations led us to establish that 5 mol % of An-PIQ/(EtCO)2O
(0.75 equiv)/K2CO3 (0.5 equiv)/iPr2O (0.1 M)/0 °C were the
optimal reaction conditions for catalytic KR of rac-1b. Under
these conditions, this protocol was investigated with diﬀerent
MBH adducts as substrates, and the results are summarized in
Table 3. The KR of most benzhydryl esters 1b−i proceeded
smoothly, providing excellent selectivity factors (up to 108)
(Table 3, entries 1−8) and extremely high ee values (up to
99.9%) for unreacted alcohols at acceptable conversion ratios.
The bulkier alkyl groups (R1) gave lower selectivity factors and
reactivities (entries 6, 7). To better understand the role of the
benzhydryl group on the selectivity factor, we examined a
variety of substrates (1j−l) without the benzhydryl ester as R2
group. It was found that all these substrates gave dramatically
lower S values (entries 9−11) compared with 1i and 1b, which
indicated the crucial eﬀect on stereoselective diﬀerentiation by
the benzhydryl group. Next, a series of structurally challenging
and synthetically versatile α- or β-functionalized MBH adducts
1m−p were also employed for this asymmetric KR (Table 3,
entries 12−15); if successful, this would aﬀord optically pure
chiral building blocks for the synthesis of bioactive natural
products, such as tulipalin B, umbelactone, (+)-fostriecin,

Surprisingly, α-benzyloxy-substituted 1m gave an extremely
low selectivity factor (S = 3), probably due to a competitive
oxygen−cation interaction between the benzyloxy oxygen atom
and the carbonyl oxygen atom with the acylated An-PIQ.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
According to Shinna’s reports,12 a carbonyl oxygen−cation
interaction was proposed to account for the high selectivity
factor in the KR of racemic 2-hydroxyalkanoates (Scheme 2). If
it is true, we envisaged that a sterically bulky protecting group
instead of benzyl would decrease or even avoid this
competition, which would therefore lead to a higher stereo-
selectivity. As expected, a TBS-protected substrate 1n was
found to be suitable for the KR, aﬀording a dramatically
improved S value of 37. In order to further conﬁrm the
this hypothetical competitive oxygen−cation
existence of
interaction between the benzyloxy oxygen atom or the carbonyl

oxygen atom and the acylated An-PIQ, substrate 1o, with one
more carbon than 1m, was subjected to the KR and found to
give an improved S value equal to 24, providing corresponding
unreacted (R)-1o in 99.1% ee. To our delight, a TBS-protected
substrate 1p gave an excellent selectivity factor (S = 75), which
was comparable to that of substrates 1d−f with longer alkyl
chains.

In order to further demonstrate the utility of this protocol,

(S)-1n, (R)-1p, (R)-1o in over 99.0% ee with good to excellent
selectivity factors (S = 20−82). (R)-1b and (R)-1o were then
subjected to transesteriﬁcation to provide the corresponding
methyl esters (R)-6 and (R)-7 in 81% and 86% yield,
respectively, which can be used for the synthesis of some

Therefore, a substrate without a carbon−carbon double bond

double bond (Scheme 4). Notably, the selectivity factor (S =

In conclusion, we have developed a highly eﬀective non-
racemic α-methylene-β-hydroxy
enzymatic acylative KR of
esters with diﬀerent alkyl side chains by use of the acyl transfer
catalyst An-PIQ and propionic anhydride, providing recovered
alcohols with extremely high ee’s (up to >99%) in reasonable

conversions and excellent selectivity factors (S up to 108). This
work complements the asymmetric MBH reaction, especially
for substrates derived from aliphatic aldehydes. This method
was also successfully applied to the KR on gram-scale of
important building blocks of several bioactive compounds, and
the corresponding optically pure α-methylene-β-hydroxy esters
were obtained with excellent ee values.

General Information. All reagents and starting materials were
obtained commercially and used as received unless otherwise stated.
Solvents and reagents were dried in advance. Catalyst An-PIQ, Np-
PIQ, Br-PIQ, Fc-PIP, (S)-Cl-PIQ, and (R)-BTM were synthesized
according to literature procedures.4b,5 1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a 400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3. Chemical shifts are reported in
ppm with the internal TMS signal at 0.0 ppm as a standard. The
spectra are interpreted as s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q =
quartet, m = multiplet, br s = broad single, coupling constant(s) in
hertz, and relative integrations are reported. 13C NMR spectra were
recorded on a 400 MHz spectrometer in CDCl3. Chemical shifts are
reported in ppm with the internal chloroform signal at 77.0 ppm as a
standard.

Methods used for kinetic resolution experiments determination of
ee’s and calculation of conversions and selectivities were adopted from
previously published work.5 Enantiomeric excess values were
determined by analysis of HPLC traces, obtained by using chiralpak
AD-H, AS-H, OD-H, OJ-H, or IF-H columns with hexane and 2-
propanol or EtOAc as solvents. Selectivity factors and conversions
were calculated from the enantiomeric excess values of the ester
products and the recovered unreacted alcohol substrates according to
Kagan’s equations.14,15

mixture was stirred at 0 °C for 5 min, propionyl anhydride (0.15
mmol) was added, the resulting solution was stirred at 0 °C for the
speciﬁed period and quenched by rapid addition of 0.2 mL of
methanol. The solution was warmed to room temperature and stirred
for an additional 2 h. The solvent was removed in vacuo and the
residue puriﬁed by silca gel chromatography (5−10% EtOAc/
petroleum) to separate the ester from the unreacted alcohol.

2. Preparation of Racemic Carboxylates of α-Methylene-β-
hydroxy Esters. To a solution of racemic α-methylene-β-hydroxy
ester (1.0 equiv) in i-Pr2O (0.2 M) were added (±)-tetramisole (0.5
equiv), K2CO3 (1.0 equiv), and (R3CO)2O (1.0 equiv). The mixture
was stirred at room temperature and monitored by TLC. The mixture
was extracted with DCM, and the combined organic phases were
washed with brine and concentrated by reduced pressure to get the
crude product, which was puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica
gel (petroleum/EtOAc = 10/1).

3. Preparation of Benzhydryl 3-Hydroxybutanoate (rac-1q).
Compound 8 was prepared according to literature procedures.16 To
a solution of 8 (536.6 mg, 2 mmol) in ethanol (8 mL) at 0 °C was

(14) Enantioselectivity in kinetic resolutions is usually expressed in
terms of a selectivity factor (S) deﬁned as the ratio between reaction
rates of the fast- and the slow-reacting enantiomers of the starting
racemate: S = kfast/kslow. If the starting material is racemic, both the
conversion (C) and the selectivity factors can be calculated from the ee
values of the product and the recovered substrate according to the
following Kagan’s equations: C = eeSM/(eeSM + eePR); s = ln[(1 − C)
(1 − eeSM)]/ln[(1− C)(1 + eeSM)].
