ABSTRACT: Two radical-mediated cascade couplings of N-alkyl-N-methacryloylbenzamides with diﬀerent ethers and
arylsulfonohydrazides to generate ether- and arylsulfonyl-substituted isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione derivatives were developed.
Both casccades proceeded via initially triggered functionalization of
the N-alkyl-N-
methacryloylbenzamides, followed by ortho radical cyclizations onto the aromatic ring to give isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione
derivatives in good yields. These highly functionalized drug-like molecules will be valuable in drug discovery in the future.

the alkene functions of

S mall molecules have played an important role in drug

discovery.1 Most drugs currently on the market are small
molecules, which regulate biological processes by binding to
such biomacromolecules as enzymes, proteins, DNA, etc.
Therefore, powerful methodologies for the syntheses of highly
functionalized small molecules for high-throughput screening
(HTS) are very valuable,2 especially those for preparing
isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione derivatives which are highly
valued in drug discovery. This class of compounds has
demonstrated several important biological activities. In Figure
1, four representative bioactive isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione
derivatives are shown.3 These bioactivities include HIV-1
integrase inhibitors,3a antitumor activity against a human
pancreatic carcinoma cell line,3b potent and selective inhibitors
of cyclin-dependent kinase 4,3c and a potent caspase-3
inhibitor.3d Developing convenient syntheses of such molecules
has attracted considerable attention from medicinal chemists.
Producing these functionalized molecules eﬃciently is both an
opportunity and a challenge.

Several methods to make isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione
derivatives have already been reported.4 A few cascade methods
employing oxidative cross-couplings to bifunctionalize alkene
substrates, followed by cyclization to produce these derivatives,
have been achieved.5 They generated highly functionalized
molecular structures in one-pot processes with good yields.
Despite this early progress,
large openings exist for further
progress. In this paper, two new cascade couplings using N-

aReaction conditions: catalysts (10 mol %), tetrahydrofuran (0.5 mL),
N-methyl-N-phenylacrylamide (1.0 equiv), TBHP (tert-butyl hydro-
peroxide 70 wt % in water, 2.0 equiv), DABCO (1,4-Diazabicyclo-
[2.2.2]octane) or DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, 0.1
equiv), benzene (1.0 mL), 120 °C. Isolated yield of product 3a was

<para sub=“opt”>
contains an alkene function, tetrahydrofuran, and benzene-
sulfonohydrazide were selected as
representative starting
reactants. Previous reports7 demonstrated that copper and
iron are possible catalysts for activating ethers in the presence
of oxidants.8 When FeCl3 was selected as a catalyst (entry 1,
Table 1) with no oxidant or ligand and benzene was used as a
solvent, product 3a was observed. The introduction of TBHP
(tert-butyl hydroperoxide) into the reaction greatly changed the
situation, and the cascade reaction occurred to give a 50% yield
of ether-substituted isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione derivative
3a (entry 2). CuCl2 or Cu(OAc)2 catalysts aﬀorded only traces
of 3a (entry 5). The combination of TBHP/DBU in benzene
with FeCl3 as the catalyst gave a 65% yield (entry 6), but
TBHP/DABCO with or without benzene solvent only
generated 15% and 20% yields of 3a, respectively (entries 7
and 8). Using CuCl2 in benzene produced a trace of 3a (entry
9). A TBHP/DBU combination in EtOAc with FeCl3 aﬀorded
less than a 5% yield of 3a (entry 10). When the solvent was
switched to CH3CN, a 20% yield of 3a was achieved (entry 11).
Using Cu(OAc)2 as a catalyst in benzene with a combination of
TBHP/DABCO gave a 51% yield of 3a (entry 12). Based on
reaction condition screening, the optimal conditions selected
for this cascade reaction are FeCl3 (10 mol %), ether (0.5 mL),
N-methyl-N-phenylacrylamide (1.0 equiv), TBHP (70 wt % in
water, 2.0 equiv), and DBU (0.1 equiv) in benzene (1.0 mL) at
120 °C for 12 h.
</para>
Note
<para sub="scope">
Using these optimal reaction conditions, diﬀerent ethers
were reacted with diﬀerent N-alkyl-N-phenylacrylamides. All
reactions proceeded well. The cascade couplings gave ether-
substituted isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione derivatives 3a−j in
isolated yields ranging from 60% to 70%. Since products 3a−h
have two stereocenters,
they were each obtained as
diastereoisomer mixtures (Table 2). Their dr values were
determined based on their 1H NMR spectra.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
To determine if radicals are involved in these cascade
couplings, TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine) was used as
a radical scavenger in the reactions to prepare 3a. In the
presence of TEMPO, no coupling products were formed. This
implicates that radical mechanisms are involved in each cascade
reaction. So a plausible reaction mechanism is proposed in
Scheme 1. TBHP is split to give a tert-butoxy radical under the
action of Fe2+ and heat, and the tert-butoxy radical abstracts a
hydrogen atom from ether to generate radical A. This radical
adds to the double bond of reactant 1 to give conjugated
tertiary radical intermediate B, which adds to the aromatic ring
to give radical intermediate C. Finally radical C is oxidized by
Fe3+ and loses a proton to aﬀord product 3.

<para sub=“opt”>
Reaction condition screening was also carried out for the
coupling of benzenesulfonylhydrazine with N-methyl-N-phenyl-
acrylamide (Table 3) based on previous reports. In entry 1,
when TBAB (tetrabutylammonium bromide) was used with
less than a 5% yield of expected product 5a was
TBHP,
produced. Using KI and NaI with TBHP generated no
detectable 5a (entries 2, 3). When KI was used with TBAB
(serves as a phase transfer catalyst) and TBHP, a 10% yield of
5a was achieved (entry 4). When solvent was changed to
CH3CN, a combination of NaI with TBAB and TBHP
generated 75% yield of 5a (entry 5). CuBr, CuCl2, and
Cu(OAc)2 with TBHP gave the expected product 5a in yields
of 45%, 60%, and 55%, respectively (entries 6, 7, 8). The
combination of NaI with TBAB and TBHP generated 5a in
78% yield (entry 9). When CuBr, CuCl2, and Cu(OAc)2 were
used with TBAB and TBHP,
respectively, each reaction
produced 25%, 45%, and 75% yields of 5a (entries 10, 11,
12). After this screening, the conditions selected for further
application of this benzenesulfonyl hydrazine-triggered cascade
reaction were as follows: catalyst (20 mol %), N-methyl-N-
phenylacrylamide (1.0 equiv), benzenesulfonylhydrazine (2.0
equiv), TBHP (70 wt % in water, 2.0 equiv), and TBAB (0.5
equiv) at 90 °C for 2 h.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Using the optimal reaction conditions found above, diﬀerent
benzenesulfonylhydrazines were reacted with diﬀerent N-alkyl-
N-phenylacrylamides (Table 4). All reactions proceeded well.
These cascade couplings gave arylsulfonyl-substituted isoquino-
line-1,3(2H,4H)-dione derivatives 5a−j
in isolated yields,
ranging from 55% to 85%. The benzenesulfonylhydrazine
cascade proceeded faster
than those of ethers, giving
arylsulfonyl-substituted isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione deriva-
tives in better yields at lower temperatures. Unlike the ether
cascade reaction,
the reaction products were not diaster-
eoisomers.

To determine if a radical pathway is also involved in
benzenesulfonylhydrazine cascade reactions, TEMPO (2,2,6,6-
tetramethylpiperidine) was used as a radical scavenger in the
reaction to produce 5a. In the presence of TEMPO, no reaction
product 5a was formed. This demonstrates that a radical
mechanism sequence occurs. While similar mechanisms have
been proposed by others,4g,h a possible mechanism is proposed
in Scheme 2.

■ CONCLUSIONS

(cid:129)

In summary, we have developed two new cascade reactions
between N-alkyl-N-methacryloylbenzamides and ethers or
arylsulfonylhydrazines. Both reactions proceeded as one-pot
radical cascade processes via initially triggered radical addition
to the terminal alkene carbon of N-alkyl-N-methacryloyl-
benzamides. This was followed by radical cyclizations onto
the aromatic ring to give isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione
derivatives in good yields. Ether- or arylsulfonyl-substituted
isoquinoline-1,3(2H,4H)-dione derivatives are generated, which
are diﬃcult to achieve by traditional chemistry methods. Both
cascade sequences are suitable for compound library
production for the purpose of biological activity screening.
This chemistry also enriches current isoquinoline chemistry.
