ABSTRACT: The ﬁrst convergent synthesis of the tetrasaccharide repeating unit of the poly-
meric O antigen isolated from Acinetobacter baumannii serogroup O18 has been achieved. The
ManNAcβ1→4Gal and GalNAcβ1→3Gal units were successfully obtained through β-selective
glycosylation with 2-azido-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxymannosyl diphenyl phosphate and Tf2NH-
promoted glycosylation with 2-acetamido-2-deoxygalactosyl diethyl phosphite, respectively. The
disaccharide units could be coupled with the aid of TMSClO4 as an activator of the diphenyl
phosphate leaving group, and global deprotection completed the synthesis of the tetrasaccharide.

■ INTRODUCTION

Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are expressed at the outer membrane
of Gram-negative bacteria, and they play an important role in
bacterial virulence and resistance to innate immunity.1 Structur-
ally, LPS is characterized by a highly variable polysaccharide
attached through a core oligosaccharide to endotoxic lipid A,
which functions as an anchor to the bacterial cell. Since the
polysaccharide, comprising iterations of a repeating unit, deﬁnes
the serotype and is responsible for the O-antigenic properties,
fragments of various polysaccharides have been synthesized for
potential vaccine development and pathogen detection.2

As mentioned in the preceding paper,9b we have developed
novel glycosylation reactions capitalizing on phosphorus-
containing leaving groups.3 By use of donors with these leaving
groups, various types of glycosidic linkages could be constructed
in a stereoselective manner by appropriate choice of reaction
conditions.4−9 To demonstrate the synthetic utility of our
method, we then undertook synthesis of the tetrasaccharide
repeating unit of the polymeric O-antigen obtained from LPS
extracted from isolated, defatted cell walls of the reference strain
for Acinetobacter baumannii serogroup O18 (Figure 1).10,11 The
tetrasaccharide [ManNAcβ1→4Galα1→4(GalNAcβ1→3)Gal]
(1) contains three types of glycosidic linkages, all of which
required us to devise strategies for stereoselective construction.
As described in the preceding paper,9b we have demonstrated
that 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl diethyl phosphites could be

employed for the glycosylation of reactive alcohols, such as 3-O-
unprotected glycoside alcohol, at −78 °C (eq 1). With regard to
the synthesis of 2-acetamido-2-deoxymannosides, van der Marel

and co-workers,12 inspired by Crich’s β-mannosylation,13
developed an eﬃcient approach using 2-azido-4,6-O-benzylidene-
2-deoxy-1-thiomannoside.
In experiments patterned after
their reports, we explored the glycosylation with 2-azido-2-
deoxymannosyl donors carrying phosphorus-containing
leaving groups and ﬁnally achieved a high-yield coupling with
diphenyl phosphate as a leaving group (eq 2).8 We surmised

that the targeted tetrasaccharide 1 would be synthesized by
taking advantage of these reactions. In this paper, we describe
a convergent and stereocontrolled approach allowing access to
the tetrasaccharide 1 by capitalizing on diethyl phosphite and
diphenyl phosphate as leaving groups.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“ques”>
Our retrosynthetic analysis of tetrasaccharide 1 is depicted in
Scheme 1. We considered that selectively removable masking
groups should be employed for protection of the hydroxyl
groups at the 3-position of GalNAc and the reducing terminus,
so that the deprotected products could be used as building
blocks for synthesis of polymeric saccharides. From the
standpoint of convergency, coupling between disaccharides
914 and 10 seemed to be attractive for the construction of
tetrasaccharide 8. The acetamido group of disaccharide 9 needs
to be masked as an azide to ensure β-selective mannosylation8
of 4-O-unprotected galactoside 12.15 On the other hand,
disaccharide 10 would be available via glycosylation9 of 3-O-
unprotected galactoside 13 with 2-acetamido-2-deoxygalactosyl
diethyl phosphite 11.

the p-methoxybenzyl (PMB) group was oxidatively removed

C3 hydroxyl group was achieved by the diacetylation−selective
deacetylation sequence: the acetate at C1 could be hydrolyzed,
with the acetate at C3 remaining intact, by employing Hauser’s
conditions (H2O2, NaHCO3)19 to furnish hemiacetal 19 with an
α:β ratio of 95:5 in 92% yield. Phosphitylation of hemiacetal 19

97% yield by treatment with Ph3P in aqueous THF, followed
by acetylation with Ac2O in pyridine. Hemiacetal 25 (α:β =

With regard to glycosylation with 2-acetamido-2-deoxyga-

large scale and the unreacted alcohol could be quantitatively

Having established access to disaccharide units 9 and 10, the
stage was now set for the crucial coupling reaction. During the
course of our synthesis of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3),27 it was
found that alcohols with poor nucleophilicity favored axial
attack on the oxocarbenium ion generated from the galactosyl
phosphorodiamidate with the aid of TMSOTf in CH2Cl2, leading
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
to predominant formation of the corresponding α-glycosides.
With this precedent in mind, we ﬁrst selected TMSOTf as
promoter. As expected, tetrasaccharide 8 was obtained as a sole
product by the TMSOTf-promoted reaction of diphenyl
phosphate 9 with alcohol 10 in the presence of 5 Å molecular
sieves in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C; however, the yield was only 35% even
with 2 equiv of alcohol 10 (Table 1, entry 1).28 Gratifyingly, the
product yield was improved to 75% by use of TMSClO4 instead
of TMSOTf (entry 2).29 A solvent survey revealed that slower
reaction and reduced yield (32%)28 were observed in THF
(entry 3)30 and that the use of toluene as a cosolvent had no
discernible beneﬁt (entry 4). Examination of the temperature
proﬁle of the reaction demonstrated that a decrease in reaction
temperature resulted in a decrease in product yield (entries 2 vs
5 and 6). Stereochemical assignment of
the newly formed
stereocenter in tetrasaccharide 8 was established by a signiﬁcant
1H NOE interaction and a coupling constant (J = 2.9 Hz)
between H-1′ and H-2′.

With monosaccharide units 5 and 11−13 successfully
assembled, the remaining operations necessary for synthesis
of tetrasaccharide repeating unit 1 involved removal of all
protecting groups. Exposure of tetrasaccharide 8 to NaOMe in
MeOH eﬀected methanolysis of the acetate at the 3-position of
GalNAc to provide alcohol 27, which can be employed as an
acceptor for synthesis of the dimeric repeating unit (Scheme 5).
The allyl protecting group at the reducing terminus in 27 could
be safely removed by a two-step sequence involving
(Ph3P)3RhCl-catalyzed oleﬁn isomerization and bromination
in aqueous THF,17 to provide hemiacetal 28 in 82% overall
yield. Finally, global deprotection employing 10% Pd/C in
MeOH under a hydrogen atmosphere aﬀorded the target
tetrasaccharide 1 in 94% yield.

Scheme 5. Completion of Synthesis of Tetrasaccharide Repeating Unit

■ CONCLUSION

We have completed the ﬁrst total synthesis of the tetrasaccharide
repeating unit of
the polymeric O antigen isolated from
Acinetobacter baumannii serogroup O18 (1), wherein all of the
anomeric conﬁgurations could be controlled by proper choice
of both phosphorus-containing leaving group and reaction
conditions. The use of selectively removable protective groups
for protection of the hydroxyl groups at the 3-position of
GalNAc and the reducing terminus would allow access to
polymeric saccharides. The synthesis provides a good illustration
of
the utility of phosphorus-containing leaving groups in
oligosaccharide synthesis.

2-Azido-3-O-benzyl-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxy-D-manno-
pyranosyl Diphenyl Phosphate (5). NaOMe in MeOH (1.0 M,
0.6 mL, 0.6 mmol) was added to a solution of tert-butyldimethylsilyl
3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-azido-2-deoxy-β-D-mannopyranoside31 (1.65 g,
3.70 mmol) in MeOH (30 mL). After 1 h of stirring, the reaction
mixture was neutralized with Amberlite IR-120B acidic resin. Filtration
and evaporation in vacuo furnished the crude product (1.19 g), which
was used without further puriﬁcation.

Anhydrous p-toluenesulfonic acid (33 mg, 0.19 mmol) was added to
a stirred solution of the crude triol and benzaldehyde dimethyl acetal
(0.67 mL, 4.48 mmol) in MeCN (10 mL). After 30 min of stirring, the
reaction was quenched with Et3N (0.2 mL), and the volatile elements
were removed in vacuo. Puriﬁcation of the pale yellow residue by
column chromatography (silica gel 30 g, 9:1 → 4:1 n-hexane/AcOEt)
aﬀorded tert-butyldimethylsilyl 2-azido-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxy-β-
D-mannopyranoside (1.21 g, 80%) as a white amorphous solid.

A 60% dispersion of NaH in mineral oil (143 mg, 3.58 mmol) was
added to an ice-cooled (0 °C) mixture of the benzylidene acetal
(1.12 g, 2.75 mmol), benzyl bromide (0.43 mL, 3.58 mmol), and
Bu4NI (102 mg, 0.275 mmol) in 9:1 THF/N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) (20 mL). After 30 min of stirring, the reaction was quenched

with MeOH (0.5 mL), and the resulting mixture was partitioned
between AcOEt (70 mL) and saturated aqueous NH4Cl (10 mL).
The organic layer was successively washed with H2O (10 mL) and
brine (2 × 10 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and
evaporation in vacuo furnished the pale yellow oil, which was puriﬁed
by column chromatography (silica gel 30 g, 10:1 n-hexane/AcOEt) to
give tert-butyldimethylsilyl 2-azido-3-O-benzyl-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-

AcOEt (70 mL). The organic extract was successively washed with
saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (10 mL) and brine (2 × 10 mL) and
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and evaporation in vacuo
furnished the crude product (1.28 g), which was puriﬁed by column

Diphenyl Phosphate (9). Diphenyl chlorophosphite (50 mg,
0.20 mmol) was added to an ice-cooled (0 °C) solution of hemiacetal
25 (83 mg, 0.10 mmol) and Et3N (55 μL, 0.39 mmol) in CH2Cl2
(2 mL). After 10 min of stirring at 0 °C, the reaction was quenched
by addition of a piece of crushed ice, followed by stirring at room
temperature for 10 min. The mixture was partitioned between AcOEt
(15 mL) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (5 mL), and the organic
layer was washed with brine (2 × 10 mL) and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4. Filtration and evaporation in vacuo furnished the crude
product (164 mg, slightly yellow oil), which was puriﬁed by column
chromatography (Wako gel 4 g, 2:1 → 1:1 n-hexane/AcOEt) to give
the corresponding diphenyl phosphite (92 mg, 88%) as a colorless oil.
Potassium peroxymonosulfate (Oxone, 162 mg, 0.26 mmol) was
added to an ice-cooled (0 °C) solution of diphenyl phosphite (92 mg,
0.088 mmol) and NaHCO3 (36.9 mg, 0.44 mmol) in 2:1 acetone/
H2O (3 mL). After 30 min of stirring at 0 °C, the reaction mixture was
diluted with Et2O (2 mL) and partitioned between AcOEt (20 mL)
and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (5 mL). The organic layer was
successively washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (5 mL) and
brine (2 × 5 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and
evaporation in vacuo furnished the crude product (95 mg), which was
puriﬁed by column chromatography (Wako gel 2.5 g, 1:1 n-hexane/
AcOEt with 2% Et3N) to give diphenyl phosphate 9 (86.2 mg, 92%,

0.034 mmol) and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO; 1.2 mg,
0.011 mmol) in 9:1 EtOH/H2O (1 mL), and the mixture was heated
at 100 °C for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction
mixture was diluted with AcOEt (2 mL) and passed through a
Celite pad. The ﬁltrate was partitioned between AcOEt (15 mL) and
saturated aqueous NH4Cl (3 mL). The organic layer was washed with
brine (2 × 3 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and
evaporation in vacuo furnished the colorless oil, which was used
without further puriﬁcation.

NBS (7.6 mg, 0.041 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of the
crude prop-1-enyl glycoside in 20:1 THF/H2O (1.26 mL). After 10 min

was partitioned between AcOEt (15 mL) and 10% aqueous Na2S2O3
(3 mL). The organic layer was successively washed with 10% aqueous
Na2S2O3 (3 mL) and brine (2 × 3 mL) and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4. Filtration and evaporation in vacuo furnished the crude product
(67.2 mg, slightly yellow oil), which was puriﬁed by column

In general, either NIS or iodine has been employed to cleave
prop-1-enyl glycosides, but the use of iodine in aqueous THF in the
presence of pyridine led to partial loss of a benzylidene protecting
group if present. We therefore used NBS for oxidative hydrolysis of
prop-1-enyl groups throughout the synthesis to avoid the side reaction.
