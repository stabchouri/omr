ABSTRACT: A versatile and general route has been developed for the
asymmetric synthesis of a wide family of 3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-
benzo[b][1,4]oxazines bearing diﬀerent pattern substitutions in the
aromatic ring. Whereas hydrolases were not suitable for resolution of
these racemic cyclic nitrogenated amines, alternative chemoenzymatic
strategies were designed through independent pathways leading to both
amine antipodes. On one hand, bioreduction of 1-(2-nitrophenoxy)-
propan-2-ones allowed the recovery of the enantiopure (S)-alcohols in
high yields using the alcohol dehydrogenase from Rhodococcus ruber (ADH-A), whereas evo-1.1.200 ADH led to their
counterpart (R)-enantiomers also with complete selectivity and quantitative conversion. Alternatively, lipase-catalyzed acetylation
of these racemic alcohols, and the complementary hydrolysis of the acetate analogues, gave access to the corresponding optically
enriched products with high stereodiscrimination. Particularly attractive was the design of a chemoenzymatic strategy in six steps
for the production of (S)-(−)-7,8-diﬂuoro-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo-[b][1,4]oxazine, which is a key precursor of the
antimicrobial agent Levoﬂoxacin.

■ INTRODUCTION

Benzoxazines are privileged cyclic subunits found in a wide
range of biologically active molecules with antibacterial,
anticancer, antifungal, and antimicrobial properties,1 but they
also serve as synthetic building blocks for the formation of
more complex structures with relevant medical applications.2
The synthesis of achiral and racemic benzoxazines has been
extensively reported in the literature,3 particularly for those
bearing the 3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine fragment
(Figure 1),4 while there are fewer examples regarding the

development of asymmetric routes toward enantioenriched
benzoxazines. Optically active 3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b][1,4]-
oxazines have been mostly synthesized through asymmetric
metal-catalyzed transfer hydrogenation5 or hydrosilylation of
imines,6 organocatalytic additions,7 and broadly using chemical
kinetic resolutions of racemic benzoxazines with optically active
acyl chlorides8 or palladium-catalyzed couplings.9

Certainly, one of the most targeted benzoxazine derivatives is
Levoﬂoxacin (Figure 1), which is a potent ﬂuoroquinolone
antibacterial agent currently approved for the treatment of

for

the synthesis of

this drug and other

diﬀerent human diseases, including pneumonia, acute bacterial
sinusitis, urinary tract infections, and acute pyelonephritis.10
Asymmetric chemical strategies have been successfully carried
out
related
nonﬂuorinated analogues.5a,11 The main eﬀorts focused on
the production of (S)-(−)-7,8-diﬂuoro-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-
2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine, which serves as an adequate
synthetic building block for the total synthesis of Levoﬂoxacin.
Biocatalytic methods represent elegant and sustainable
strategies for
the production of enantiopure compounds
under mild reaction conditions. In the last couple of decades,
many organic chemists have incorporated the use of enzymes
into their toolbox,12 with lipases and alcohol dehydrogenases
currently being the most employed catalysts for use in industrial
applications, although others, such as transaminases, are
receiving signiﬁcant attention as well.13 Enzymes have been
identiﬁed as particularly useful
for the design of valuable
synthetic routes toward the synthesis of enantiopure amines by
means of
transaminases, monoamine
oxidases, and imine reductases, among others.14 In this context,
hydrolases are valuable hydrolytic enzymes that can also
catalyze acylation reactions for the selective formation of
amines through kinetic resolution processes.15 Among the
hydrolytic enzymes, lipases have attracted signiﬁcant attention
due to their selective action in the asymmetric synthesis of a
wide range of heterocyclic nitrogenated compounds.16

Surprisingly, the production of optically enriched benzoxazine
derivatives is limited to pig liver esterase-catalyzed hydrolytic
approaches, achieving moderate selectivity values.17 Herein, we
report
the production of
benzoxazine derivatives through the development of robust
chemoenzymatic methods, lipases, and oxidoreductases being
satisfactorily used for the production of target cyclic nitro-
genated compounds with good yields and excellent enantio-
meric excess values. Special attention will be paid to the
asymmetric synthesis of a valuable precursor of Levoﬂoxacin.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub="scope">
the synthesis of
To explore new asymmetric routes for
benzoxazine derivatives, we selected 3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-
benzo[b][1,4]oxazine (4a) as a model for enzymatic activity
screening. The synthesis of the racemate was performed by O-
alkylation of 2-nitrophenol (1a) using chloroacetone (2) in the
presence of potassium bromide, sodium hydrogen carbonate,
and tributylmethylammonium chloride,
followed by a palla-
dium-catalyzed hydrogenation-cyclization sequence of nitro
ketone 3a, which allowed the isolation of (±)-4a in 75% overall
yield. Because of the good levels of activity and stereoselectivity
found for lipases in the classical kinetic resolution of secondary
cyclic amines,18 a panel of commercially available lipases
(Candida antarctica lipase, types A and B; porcine pancreas
lipase; Candida rugosa lipase; and Pseudomonas cepacia lipase)
were used for the alkoxycarbonylation of 4a. Unfortunately, no
signiﬁcant activity was observed when using diﬀerent allyl
carbonates in methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) as solvent.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Searching for an alternative strategy, we took advantage of
the previous preparation of nitro ketone 3a. Then,
three
independent strategies were undertaken: (a) nonselective
reduction of ketone 3a to racemic alcohol 5a followed by
classical kinetic resolution through lipase-catalyzed acylative
processes, (b) chemical acetylation of the racemic alcohol
obtained to analyze the complementary lipase-catalyzed
hydrolytic process in depth, and (c) selective bioreduction of
prochiral ketone 3a using alcohol dehydrogenases. For these
studies, a series of benzoxazine precursors bearing diﬀerent
pattern substitutions, such as a ﬂuorine atom, a methoxy group,
or a methyl
functionality, along the aromatic ring were
chemically prepared through an eﬃcient chemical route as
depicted in Scheme 2. This includes O-alkylation of 2-
nitrophenols 1a−d, reduction of ketones 3a−d with sodium
borohydride, and later, acetylation with acetic anhydride in the
presence of DMAP and triethylamine, aﬀording the corre-
sponding racemic acetates 6a−d in good overall yields.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
The lipase-catalyzed acetylation of alcohols 5a−d was
considered ﬁrst, searching for a suitable lipase that was able
to produce the corresponding alcohols and acetates in high
optical purity (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
Alcohol 5a was selected as the model substrate, ﬁnding
Rhizomucor miehei lipase in immobilized form (RML IM) as an
ideal candidate, leading to 48% conversion in MTBE after 5 h

with 94% ee for the (R)-acetate and 89% ee for the remaining
(S)-alcohol. Other lipases, such as Candida antarctica lipase
type A (CAL-A) and Pseudomonas cepacia (PSL-C I), displayed
poor selectivities, whereas Candida antarctica lipase type B
(CAL-B) did not show signiﬁcant activity. From a set of
solvents, the best results were found with MTBE and toluene
(Table 1, entries 1 and 2); thus, the extension to alcohols 5b−d
was performed next. A similar trend was observed, achieving
the highest rates for the reactions carried out in MTBE (entries
3, 5, and 7), whereas better selectivities were attained in toluene
(entries 4, 6, and 8). MTBE was revealed to be the solvent of
choice because the conversion values were lower in toluene
(27−49%) and, furthermore, the acetate optical purity begins
to decrease at longer time periods (data not shown).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Alternatively, we decided to study lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis
of the corresponding acetates. The results are summarized in
Table 2. Because the water content is a decisive parameter for
enzymatic activity, the amount of water was studied using
substrate 6a as reference without substitutions in the aromatic
ring (entries 1−3).
In all cases, excellent selectivity was
observed, obtaining the complementary alcohol (R)-5a and
acetate (S)-6a in comparison to the lipase-catalyzed acetylation
reaction. The reaction with 5 equiv of hydrolytic agent led to
48% conversion (entry 1). Notably, increasing the amount of
water led to slower kinetics but maintained excellent stereo-
selectivity (21−35%, entries 2 and 3). Similar good results were
obtained when extending the methodology to other substituted
benzoxazine derivatives using 5 equiv of water (entries 4−6).
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
Finally, bioreduction experiments were considered on the
basis of accessing the ﬁnal product theoretically at 100% yield.
Oxidoreductases with opposite stereopreferences were em-
ployed to develop suitable routes for both alcohol antipodes.
Thus, a set composed of Prelog alcohol dehydrogenases20 from
Rhodococcus ruber (ADH-A), Candida parapsilosis (ADH-CP)
and Baker′s yeast (BY) as well as anti-Prelog enzymes,
including Lactobacillus brevis (ADH-LB), Lactobacillus kefir
(ADH-LK), and evo-1.1.200 ADH, were screened in 50 mM

Once a powerful chemoenzymatic strategy was developed for
the asymmetric synthesis of a representative number of 3-
methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine derivatives, ef-
forts turned to focus on the development of an eﬃcient and
selective preparation of the Levoﬂoxacin precursor (4e, 7,8-
diﬂuoro-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazine). For
this reason, a similar
route was attempted starting from
commercially available 2,3-diﬂuoro-6-nitrophenol (1e) as
depicted in Scheme 4. O-alkylation proceeded in 85% yield
for the formation of nitro ketone 3e, which was subjected to
ADH-A-catalyzed bioreduction, leading to enantiopure (S)-5e
after 24 h in 91% isolated yield using a Tris-HCl pH 7.5 buﬀer.
For the preparation of its (R)-5e counterpart, the use of evo-
1.1.200 was attempted, which resulted in complete selectivity,
though the structural isomer 2-(2,3-diﬂuoro-6-nitrophenoxy)-
propan-1-ol (11) was also found as a side product. For this
reason, the bioreduction was carried out at diﬀerent pHs,
minimizing the formation of 11 at lower pH values (6−6.5),
which yielded the alcohol (R)-5e in 94% isolated yield after 24
h at 30 °C in a Tris-HCl pH 6 buﬀer. It must be mentioned
that the (R)-conﬁguration is required for the formation of
Levoﬂoxacin; thus, the use of evo-1.1.200 seems to be an
excellent tool for introducing a desired chirality.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
In addition, the lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of racemic acetate
6e was attempted, which would give direct access to the desired
(R)-alcohol 5e. First, the chemical reduction of ketone 3e was
initially performed with sodium borohydride. In this case, the
unexpected formation of a 61:39 mixture of the desired alcohol
(±)-5e and the structural
isomer 2-(2,3-diﬂuoro-6-
nitrophenoxy)propan-1-ol (11) was observed. The formation
of
this side-product was mostly suppressed using a mild
reducing agent, such as the ammonia borane complex,22 thus
avoiding basic reaction medium as well as a basic workup in the
reaction, recovering 5e in 78% yield after 1 h at 30 °C. Then,
the alcohol was chemically acetylated in 93% yield using acetic
anhydride to later explore its RML IM-catalyzed hydrolysis.
After 53 h, total selectivity toward the formation of the (R)-
alcohol was attained, obtaining (S)-acetate 6e in 84% ee and
the desired enantiopure (R)-alcohol 5e in 45% isolated yield.

Two diﬀerent classes of enzymes have eﬃciently served in the
development of asymmetric synthesis of both 3-methyl-3,4-

drogenases and lipases have been identiﬁed as good catalysts for
the synthesis of valuable optically active precursors as key

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Ketones 3a−e. To a
solution of the corresponding nitrophenol 1a−e (3.02 mmol) in
toluene (1 mL) were added successively chloroacetone (481 μL, 6.04
mmol), potassium bromide (43 mg, 0.36 mmol), sodium hydrogen
carbonate (279 mg, 3.32 mmol), and a tributylmethylammonium
chloride solution (75% weight in water, 16 μL, 0.065 mmol). The
mixture was stirred and heated at 65 °C for 6 h, and then additional
chloroacetone (120 μL, 1.51 mmol) was added. The reaction was
further heated at 65 °C for 18 h, and after this time, water (1 mL) was
added. The pH of the mixture was adjusted to 6.5−7 at 55−60 °C by
the addition of 1N HCl (between 7 and 15 drops). The layers were
separated in a separatory funnel, and the aqueous phase was discarded.
Then, an aqueous 5% NaCl solution (2 mL) was added to the organic
phase and transferred to a round-bottom ﬂask. The resulting mixture
was vigorously stirred at 55−60 °C for 10 min. The layers were again
separated in a separatory funnel, the organic layer was collected, dried
over Na2SO4, and ﬁltered and the solvent was removed by distillation
under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was washed with
toluene to ensure complete chloroacetone removal, aﬀording the
corresponding pure ketones 3a−e (84−93%).

catalyst was ﬁltered through a diatomaceous earth plug. The reaction
crude was obtained after solvent evaporation and puriﬁed by column
chromatography on silica gel (20% Et2O/hexane), aﬀording racemic
benzoxazine 4a (245 mg, 80% yield). The spectroscopic data are in
agreement with those previously reported in the literature using a

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Racemic Nitro
Alcohols 5a−d. Sodium borohydride (19 mg, 0.50 mmol) was added
to a solution of the corresponding ketones 3a−d (1.00 mmol) in dry
MeOH (3.8 mL) at 0 °C. The solution was stirred at
room
temperature for 45 min, quenching the reaction by the addition of
water (10 mL). MeOH was removed by distillation under reduced
pressure, and the aqueous residue was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 10
mL). The organic layers were combined, dried, and the solvent
removed by distillation under
reduced pressure, aﬀording the
corresponding nitro alcohols 5a−d (87−94%).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Racemic and
Optically Active Amino Alcohols 8a−e. A hydrogen atmosphere
was generated using a hydrogen balloon connected to a round-bottom
ﬂask, which contained a suspension of
the corresponding nitro
alcohols 5a−e (2.50 mmol) and PtO2 (150 mg, 0.66 mmol) in dry
MeOH (14 mL). The resulting suspension was stirred at room
temperature overnight, and then the reaction was stopped by ﬁltering
the mixture through a diatomaceous earth plug. The solvent was
removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the crude was
puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc/hexane
mixtures), aﬀording the corresponding amino alcohols 8a−e (65−
98%).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Racemic and
Optically Active Sulfonamides 9a−e. Pyridine (56 μL, 0.69
mmol) and p-toluensulfonyl chloride (134 mg, 0.70 mmol) were
added to a solution of the corresponding amino alcohols 8a−e (0.54
mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (13.5 mL). The solution was stirred at room
temperature for 12 h until complete disappearance of the starting
material was observed by TLC analysis. Almost all the solvent was
removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the resulting
residue was dissolved in EtOAc (20 mL) and washed with an aqueous
saturated NH4Cl solution (2 × 20 mL), an aqueous HCl 1 M solution
(2 × 20 mL), and ﬁnally an aqueous saturated NaCl solution (2 × 20
mL). The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, ﬁltered, and
concentrated by distillation under
reduced pressure. The crude
product was puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel
(EtOAc/hexane mixtures), aﬀording the corresponding sulfonamides
9a−e (71−80%).
