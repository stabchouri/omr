ABSTRACT: Enyne cross metathesis of propargylamines with
ethyl vinyl ether enables the one-pot synthesis of substituted
pyrroles. A series of substituted pyrroles, bearing alkyl, aryl, and
heteroaryl substituents, has been synthesized in good yields under
microwave irradiation. The reactions are rapid and procedurally
simple and also represent a facile entry to the synthetically
challenging 1,2,3-substituted pyrroles. The value of the method-
ology is further corroborated by the conversion of pyrroles into 3-
methyl-pyrrolines and the derivatization of the 3-methyl-substituent arising from the metathesis reaction.

toward this

T he occurrence of the pyrrole nucleus in many natural and

synthetic biologically active compounds represents an
incentive toward the development of new synthetic method-
important heterocycle.1 Metathesis
ologies
reactions have been established as a powerful and eﬀective
method for the construction of many functionalized hetero-
from acyclic unsaturated precursors.1b Pioneering
cycles
approaches to the synthesis of substituted pyrroles through
ring closing metathesis (RCM) were reported by Donohoe2
and Rutjes.3 These studies are based on the oleﬁn RCM
synthesis of 3-pyrrolines starting from appropriate allylamines,
followed by an elimination step catalyzed by acids. An evolution
of this approach has been the development of one-pot RCM-
aromatization sequences using RuCl3,4 Pd/C,5a FeCl3,5b or
tBuOOH6 to promote the dehydrogenative step. More recently,
Donohoe7 and Grela8 described an oleﬁn cross-metathesis
(CM) approach for the synthesis of pyrroles. The alkyne-alkene
(enyne) metathesis reaction oﬀers advantages over the oleﬁn
version in terms of atom economy and it has found large
application in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds as
well.9,10 However, to the best of our knowledge only one paper
by Stevens and co-workers11 describes the synthesis of pyrroles
via a ring-closing enyne metathesis−aromatization sequence,
while no examples to access pyrroles via the enyne CM have
been reported so far. Herein, we describe the ﬁrst approach to
substituted pyrroles through a one-pot tandem enyne CM
cyclization reaction starting from appropriate propargylamines
and the cheap ethyl vinyl ether (EVE) (Figure 1). In our early
work, we demonstrated that EVE can be used as the oleﬁn
synthetic equivalent of
the acetaldehyde in enyne CM
reactions, leading to the formation of crotonaldehydes when
reacted with terminal alkynes in the presence of the weak Lewis
acid CuSO4.12 Herein, we demonstrate that an analogous
strategy is applicable to the synthesis of pyrroles when

propargylamines are used as substrates. Moreover, our CM-
cyclization protocol oﬀers an easy approach to the synthetically
challenging pyrroles 3 unsubstituted at positions C4 and C5.
Only a few examples for the synthesis of 4,5-unsubstituted
pyrroles have been reported so far, most of them relying on
multistep synthetic sequences.13

amine 4a was ﬁrst reacted with EVE in the presence of Grubbs’
catalyst G-II under microwave irradiation according to our
previous method.12 When the reaction was carried out at 80 °C
in an aqueous solution the desired pyrrole 6a was obtained in
25−29% yield (entries 1−2), while a slightly higher amount
(36%, entry 3) was isolated when the reaction was run in
degassed toluene. The use of a higher catalyst loading (entry 2)
did not lead to any improvement of the yield. Increasing the
temperature to 120 °C and the reaction time to 30 min proved
to be beneﬁcial and the yield rose to 56% (entry 4). When the
reaction was performed under the same conditions and without
CuSO4 the pyrrole 6a was not detected and the corresponding
diene 5 was recovered in 41% yield (entry 5).On the other
hand, the use of a stoichiometric amount of CuSO4 led to 6a in
only 18% yield (entry 6). It is noteworthy that heating the
diene intermediate 5 in reﬂuxing toluene led to pyrrole 6a in 24
h, while in the presence of CuSO4 the reaction was completed
in 6 h. We hypothesize that CuSO4 plays a crucial role in
increasing the rate of the cyclization reaction presumably by
coordinating the ethoxy group.14

It is reported that, contrary to the electron poorer anilines
and tertiary hindered amines,
the aliphatic primary and
secondary amines poison the Ru-catalysts thus preventing the
metathesis reactions.15 The addition of a Brønsted acid to
secondary amines makes the lone pair unable to bind the
ruthenium, allowing the metathesis reaction to occur.16 Amine

the reaction (entry 8). The
inﬂuence of diﬀerent amine group substituents on the outcome
of the reaction was then explored. A set of propargylamines
4b−e was synthesized according to Table 2. The treatment of
the tosyl derivative 4b with 10 mol % of G-II led to desired 6b
in 53% yield, while a lower amount of 6b (25%) was recovered
when 5 mol % of catalyst was used (entry 1). The benzoyl
compound 4d aﬀorded the pyrrole 6d in moderate yield (entry
3). On the other hand, the propargylaniline 4c aﬀorded the
phenylpyrrole 6c in good yield (entry 2), while the benzyl-

mixture and no pyrrole 6e was observed (entry 4).

products was recovered. The possibility to synthesize 1,2,3-

starting from the appropriate 1-
substituted propargylamines and using this tandem meta-
thesis−cyclization protocol was explored. A ﬁrst batch of aryl-
propargylacetamides 8a−e was synthesized in high yields from
the appropriate propargylic alcohols (Scheme 1, Path a).17

<para sub="scope">
Hydrolysis of 8a−b followed by Boc-, Bz-, and Ts-
protections led to substrates 8f−h. Propargyl alcohol 7 was
acetylated to give 9 and in turn converted into the phenyl
substrate 10 through a copper mediated amination reaction18
(Scheme 1, Path a). A multicomponent strategy19 was used for
the synthesis of aliphatic and heteroaryl derivatives 15a−d. The
appropriate aldehydes 11a−d were reﬂuxed in toluene in the
presence of p-toluenesulfonamide 12, TIPS-acetylene 13, and
Cu(OTf)2 aﬀording, after silyl-deprotection with TBAF, the
terminal alkynes 15a−d (Scheme 1, path b). The alkynes 8, 10,
and 15 were then converted into pyrroles 6. Results are
reported in Table 3. Acetamides 8a−e were ﬁrst reacted with
EVE and G-II leading to the desired pyrroles 6f−j in high yields
(59−76%). Only pyrrole 6i bearing a dichloro-phenyl group
was obtained in lower yield (38%) probably due to a
combination of steric and electronic factors. The pyrroles 6l
and 6m, bearing the bulky groups Boc and Bz, were obtained in
lower yields than the acetyl analogue 6g. Similarly,
the
tosylpyrrole 6k was isolated in lower yield than 6f. Reactions
were performed using both a 5 mol % and 10 mol % Grubbs’
catalyst
in the case of 1-susbtituted
propargylamines a lower catalyst loading resulted into poorer
yields. On the other hand, the aliphatic and the furyl N-tosyl-
propargylamides 15a−d were converted into pyrroles 6o−r in
excellent yields with the only exception the bulky cyclohexyl
derivative 6p. Finally, treatment of the substrate 10 with EVE

In conclusion, a new approach for the synthesis of pyrroles
based on an enyne cross metathesis−cyclization cascade has
been described. The present methodology represents the ﬁrst
example of one-pot synthesis of pyrroles via enyne cross-
metathesis reaction and it constitutes a facile approach to the
synthetically challenging 1,2,3-substituted pyrroles. Finally, the
versatility of the method was shown through the synthesis of
pyrroline analogues as well as the derivatization of the methyl
substituent at C3.

Splitting patterns are abbreviated as follows: singlet (s), doublet (d),
triplet (t), quartet (q), multiplet (m), broad (br), or
some
combination of these. Positive and negative electrospray ionization
spectrometry (ESI-MS) were conducted by direct injection. GC-MS
analyses were performed using aliquots of the compound dissolved in
DCM (5 μL) and injected onto a DB-5MS (30 mm × 0.25 mm i.d. ×
0.15 μm ﬁlm thickness) column at 250 °C. The oven temperature was
set at 40 °C for 4 min and raised at 15 °C/min to 135 °C, then at 5
°C/min to 250 °C and held at 250 °C for 5 min. The carrier gas ﬂow
was 1.0 mL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the full scan
mode. The transfer line and ion source temperatures were 250 and 200
°C, respectively. A LTQ Orbitrap XL instrument was used for the
HRMS measurements. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was
performed using commercially available precoated plates and
visualized with UV light at 254 nm; KMnO4 or Ninhydrin dips were
used to reveal the products. Flash column chromatography was carried
out using Fluorochem Davisil 40−63u 60 Å. All reactions were
conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere in oven-dried glassware unless
stated otherwise. Tetrahydrofuran was distilled under nitrogen from
sodium using a benzophenone indicator. Dichloromethane, toluene,
and diethyl ether were obtained by distillation over calcium hydride
under a nitrogen atmosphere. Petrol refers to the fraction of light
petroleum ether boiling between 40 and 65 °C. All other solvents and
commercially available reagents were used as received. All chemicals
and solvents were used as supplied, unless noted otherwise.

Microwave Irradiation Experiments. Microwave irradiations
were conducted using a CEM Discover Synthesis Unit. The machine
consists of a continuous focused microwave power delivery system
with operator, selectable power output
from 0 to 300 W. The
temperature of the contents of the vessels was monitored using a
calibrated infrared temperature control mounted under the reaction
vessel. All the experiments were performed using a stirring option
whereby the contents of the vessel are stirred by means of rotating
magnetic plate located below the ﬂoor of the microwave cavity and a
Teﬂon, coated magnetic stirring bar in the vessel.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 3-Methyl-Pyrroles 6. Ethyl
vinyl ether (9 equiv), CuSO4 (2 equiv) and Grubbs’ catalyst second
generation (5−10 mol %) were added to a microwave vial containing a
solution of the appropriate propargylamine derivative (50 mg, 1 equiv)
in 3 mL of degassed toluene. The reaction mixture was heated at 120
°C under microwave irradiation (300 W) for 2 × 10 min. The
maximum internal pressure observed during the reaction was 44 psi.
The reaction mixture was then quenched with 10 mL of saturated
NH4Cl solution, 0.5 mL of NH4OH solution, and 10 mL of Et2O. The
aqueous layer was extracted twice with Et2O. The combined organic
layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated
under reduced pressure. All the crude products were puriﬁed by ﬂash
column chromatography (SiO2) using 1:4 Et2O/hexanes as the eluent
to yield the desired pyrroles 6 as tan oils.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Pyrroles 18 and 20.
Sodium cyanoborohydride (0.38 mmol, 3 equiv) was added to a
round-bottom ﬂask containing triﬂuoroacetic acid (2 mL). The
solution was allowed to stir for 20 min at room temperature. Then the
appropriate pyrrole 6b or 6r (0.127 mmol, 1 equiv) was added to the
solution previously obtained. The solution was allowed to stir at room
temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was then quenched with 10
mL of water and 10 mL of DCM. The aqueous layer was extracted
twice with DCM. The combined organic layers were washed with a
saturated solution, brine, dried over Na2SO4, and
NaHCO3
concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude pyrrolines 18 and
20 proved to be pure enough to be used in the next synthetic step
without any further puriﬁcation.
