ABSTRACT: A novel heterogeneous catalytic hydrogena-
tion−hydrogenolysis strategy has been developed for the α-
methylation of ketones via enaminones using DMF dimethyl
acetal as carbon source. This strategy provides a very
convenient route to α-methylated ketones using a variety of
ketones without any base or oxidant.

M ethyl functionalization of a carbon center using a readily

available catalyst and carbon source is a challenging task
for chemists. Methylation is not only associated with biological
processes but also has signiﬁcant value in synthetic chemistry
for ﬁne chemical synthesis and functionalization of biologically
active molecules.1 α-Methylation of ketones is one of the most
important and frequently used methods in organic synthesis.2
Alkylation of enolate is the classical method for this reaction,
where the carbonyl compounds are intended to be an enolate
nucleophile to attack an electrophilic alkylating agent.3 Most
commonly, strong bases are used to ensure all the starting
carbonyl converts into its corresponding enolate anion to avoid
self-condensation of carbonyl compounds. Furthermore,
low
temperature (about −78 °C) is required for some reactive
enolate species to survive. To improve this reaction, several
methods have been developed such as the use of KH−BEt3

methylation of ketones using DMF as carbon source; where
strong oxidant persulfate was used to form an iminium
intermediate of DMF for the enolate attack.11 Additionally
Rh- and Ir-catalyzed α-methylation of ketones using methanol
as methyl source have been reported independently by the
Donohoe12 and Obora13 groups. However,
in both cases,
strong bases are required and double methylation occurs. In
this context, there is a strong desire for the development of new
synthetic strategy for the α-methylation of ketone using readily
available reagent and catalyst without any base or oxidant.
Recently, we have developed a Pd−graphene composite
material as catalyst for C−C bond formation and reduction of
C−C double bonds. While screening the reaction conditions,
we were surprised to ﬁnd that hydrogenation of enaminone
derived from acetophenone and dimethylformamide−dimethyl
acetal (DMF−DMA) produced phenylpropanol. This ﬁnding
prompted us to explore the possibility of developing a novel

synthetic strategy for the α-methylation of carbonyl com-
pounds. On the other hand, enaminones are versatile synthetic
intermediates for the synthesis of various heterocycles14 and
other valuable products.15 To the best of our knowledge,
this intermediate has not been used for the α-
however,
methylation of ketone. Herein, we report a novel synthetic
strategy for α-methylation of ketones. Our synthetic strategy
consists of condensation of ketones with DMF−DMA followed
by hydrogenation−hydrogenolysis of enaminones. The novel
hydrogenation−hydrogenolysis step was catalyzed by Pd/C
under H2 atmosphere (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. α-Methylation of Ketones via Enaminones
<para sub=“opt”>
Initially, acetophenone 1a was chosen as the model substrate
the α-methylation via enaminone 2a with various
for
heterogeneous catalysts, and extensive investigations were
carried out to optimize the reaction conditions (Table 1).
The synthesis of enaminones from ketones and DMF−DMA is
well precedente, and this intermediate was used for hydro-
genation−hydrogenolysis reaction without chromatographic
puriﬁcation.16 As a starting point, hydrogenation experiments
were performed using 10 mol % of Pd/C in the presence of H2
(balloon) for 12 h at rt, giving the phenylpropanol 4a. Under
the same reaction conditions, other heterogeneous catalysts
such as Pd/CaCO3, Pd/Al2O3, Pd/SiO2, and Ru/C gave a
moderate yield of 4a along with 3a. As a control experiment,
the reaction was performed in the absence of catalyst, and no
product was observed. The catalyst Pd/C was considered and
particularly chosen in this strategy for the α-methylation of
ketones as it is commercially available and inexpensive. With
the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we examined the
scope of the reaction in order to establish the generality of our

Notably, substrates with a strong electron-donating group
substituted at
the aryl ring aﬀorded
phenylpropanol 4 in only moderate yields along with the α-
methylated keto product 3 (Table 2, entries 3, 6, and 8).
However, an electron-donating group at the meta-position gave
a good yield of alcohol 4 along with a trace of α-methylated
keto product 3 (Table 2, entry 4). Surprisingly, the ortho-
substituted aryl methyl ketones, regardless of their electronic
nature as electron-donating or electron-withdrawing, exclusively
gave the α-methylated keto products 3, which might be due to
the steric eﬀect (Table 2, entries 12−15). N,N-Dimethylace-
tophenone 1j exceptionally gave the corresponding phenyl-
propanol 4j in high yield, which could be used as a raw material
for the synthesis of the potent histone deacetylase inhibitor
(±)-trichostatin A.17 The cyclic ketones were also investigated,
and the α-methylated keto products were obtained in good
yields (Table 2, entries 18 and 19). The yield of α-methylated
keto products 3r and 3s also might be caused by the steric
eﬀect of fused rings. Having succeeded in the α-methylation of
aryl methyl ketones, we extended this
the
methylation of heteroaryl methyl ketones. Accordingly, N-
protected indole derivative 1-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-
ethanone 1t was condensed with DMF−DMA followed by
hydrogenation−hydrogenolysis over Pd/C under H2 (balloon).

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Information. All chemicals were used as received without
further puriﬁcation. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at
ambient temperature on a 300 or 500 MHz NMR spectrometer (75 or
125 MHz for 13C). NMR chemical shifts are reported on the δ scale
(ppm) downﬁeld from tetramethylsilane (δ = 0.0 ppm) using the
residual solvent signal at δ = 7.26 ppm (1H) or δ = 77 ppm (13C) as
internal standard. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift,
multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m =
multiplet, br = broad). IR spectra were recorded on a spectropho-
tometer using CHCl3. Hydrogenation under pressure (2.5 bar) was
carried out in hydrogenation apparatus. Column chromatography was
performed with silica gel 60 (100−200 mesh).
Experimental Procedure for the Synthesis of Enaminones
2a−w (2a as an Example). Acetophenone 1a (1 mmol) and DMF−
DMA (20 mmol) was stirred at 120 °C (oil bath) in an open ﬂask.
After disappearance of the reactant (monitored by TLC), water was
added to the mixture (50 mL), and the mixture was extracted with
EtOAc (3 × 30 mL). The extract was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4
and concentrated. The crude residue was used for the one-pot
hydrogenation−hydrogenolysis reaction without chromatographic
puriﬁcation [L-proline (5 mol %) was added during the synthesis of
2p, 2q, 2t, and 2v].16
Experimental Procedure for the Hydrogenation−Hydro-
genolysis of Enaminones (4a as an Example). Crude enaminone
2a as obtained from the previous step was dissolved in ethanol (20
mL). 10% Pd/C (106 mg, 10 mol % of 1a) was added, and the
heterogeneous mixture was vigorously stirred at room temperature
under atmospheric hydrogen pressure (balloon) for 12 h. The reaction
mixture was ﬁltered (using a Buchner funnel with sintered disk) and
washed with ethanol (2 × 10 mL). The ﬁltrate and washings were
combined and concentrated under
the
evaporation, the residue was puriﬁed by column chromatography on
silica gel (ethyl acetate/hexanes, 1:10) to aﬀord the product 4a. (For
crude substrates 2k,l,p,q,w, 2.5 bar hydrogen pressure was used instead
of hydrogen balloon in a hydrogenation apparatus.)

ﬁltered (using a Buchner funnel with sintered disk) and washed with
ethanol (2 × 10 mL). The ﬁltrate and washings were combined and
concentrated under reduced pressure. After the evaporation,
the
residue was puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel (ethyl
acetate/hexanes, 1:10) to aﬀord 4a (120 mg; 88% Yield).
