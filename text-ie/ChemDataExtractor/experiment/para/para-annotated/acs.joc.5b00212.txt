ABSTRACT: A highly enantioselective [4+2] annulation with
respect to allenoates and 3-oleﬁnic oxindoles catalyzed by
Lewis base was reported, which proved to be an eﬃcient way to
synthesize chiral dihydropyran-fused indoles. The cycloaddition
products were generally obtained in high yields (up to 98%)
with very good enantioselectivities (up to 94% enantiomeric
excess).

motifs

D ihydropyran-fused indoles, which are important structural

in natural products and biologically active
molecules, have attracted wide synthetic interest.1 Great eﬀorts
have been devoted to the construction of this valuable scaﬀold.2
However, the study of direct asymmetric catalysis processes for
these compounds, to the best of our knowledge, has been very
limited. In 2010, Ye reported the ﬁrst example of a chiral N-
heterocyclic carbene (NHC)-catalyzed [4+2] cycloaddition
reaction of ketenes and 3-alkylenyloxindoles to give the
corresponding 3,4-dihydropyrano[2,3-b]indol-2-ones in excel-
lent yields with good diastereo- and enantioselectivities.3 In
2012, Zhong developed a chiral NHC-catalyzed Diels−Alder
reaction of 2-oxindolin-3-ylidenes and α-chloroaldehydes,
which synthesized the fused pyrano[2,3-b]indoles in good to
excellent yields with very good stereoselectivities.4 In 2013, Zhu
and Cheng presented the example of accessing optically active
dihydropyran-fused indoles through chiral calcium phosphate-
catalyzed enantioselective hetero-Diels−Alder
reactions be-
tween 2-oxoindlin-3-ylidenes and alkyl vinyl ethers (Figure 1).5
Despite these elegant contributions, the catalytic asymmetric
synthesis of chiral dihydropyran-fused indole derivatives is still
in its infancy, and novel catalytic processes are highly desirable.
Allenoates as an attractive substrate class, which can be
catalyzed by Lewis base, have become an integral part of the
synthesis of cyclic compounds in recent years.6 After the
pioneering phosphine-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition of alle-
noates with alkenes by Lu in 1995,7 a large number of
annulations between allenoates and electron-deﬁcient oleﬁns or
imines were developed, providing a variety of carbocycles and
heterocycles with multifunctional groups.8 However, examples
of the construction of six-membered oxygenated heterocycles,
such as dihydropyrans and dihydropyranones, which are
privileged structural motifs
in biological and medicinal
molecules,9 are very limited.10 To the best of our knowledge,
there is only one report of the synthesis of chiral dihydropyran
skeletons catalyzed by chiral phosphine.11 On the other hand,
amine-catalyzed cycloadditions
to allenoates have been
disclosed by at least four groups over the past few years.12 In

Figure 1. Application of 3-alkenyloxindoles in asymmetric synthesis of
dihydropyran-fused indoles.

2011, Tong and Borhan reported an asymmetric [4+2]
cycloaddition of allenoates with α,β-unsaturated ketone,
which aﬀorded dihydropyran derivatives in high yields and
enantioselectivities.12a,b More recently, Shi and Wei developed
an asymmetric [4+2] cycloaddition of β,γ-unsaturated α-
ketoesters and α-ketophosphonates with allenic esters by the
amine type organocatalysts.12c,d Furthermore, Shi and Wei also
realized a highly enantioselective [2+2] annulation of allenoates
with triﬂuoromethyl ketones using an analogous cinchona
alkaloid-derived catalyst.12f In addition, Sasai reported a chiral
amine-catalyzed [2+2] cycloaddition of ketimines with
allenoates.12g

According to the consideration mentioned above, the Lewis
base-catalyzed [4+2] cycloadditions of 3-oleﬁnic oxindoles with

allenoates have been studied, but their asymmetric syntheses
are being explored.13 We report herein a transformation of 3-
oleﬁnic oxindole by tertiary amine type Lewis base catalyst
(Figure 1).
In practice, an asymmetric [4+2] annulation
between allenoates and 3-oleﬁnic oxindoles was achieved,
thus generating enantiomerically enriched dihydropyran-fused
indole derivatives.14
<para sub=“opt”>
We initiated the study with six widely used tertiary amine
catalysts 4a−f (20 mol %) in CHCl3 at room temperature and
investigated the reaction between (E)-tert-butyl 3-benzylidene-
2-oxindoline-1-carboxylate 1a and ethyl 2,3-butadienoate 2a as
a model (Table 1, entries 1−6). To our delight, all the catalysts
promoted the reaction with diﬀerent yields, very good
regioselectivities, and moderate to good enantioselectivities.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
Among the six catalysts examined, β-isocupreidine (4c) was
identiﬁed as the optimal one because of its stereoselectivity and
eﬃciency (Table 1, entry 3).
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
A solvent screening was then conducted (Table 1, entries 3
and 7−14). It was found that benzene type solvents gave
relatively good results. Among the screened benzene type
solvents, toluene gave the best result,
in which cyclization
product 3a was obtained in 94% yield, with >20:1
regioselectivity and 74% enantiomeric excess (ee) (Table 1,

entry 11). Unfortunately, lowering the reaction temperature in
toluene decreases the enantioselectivity (Table 1, entry 15). Via
further exploration of the reaction conditions, the employment
of CHCl3 at −30 °C was found to aﬀord optimal results with an
80% yield, a >20:1 regioselectivity, and an 87% ee (Table 1,
entry 16).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Having established the optimal

reaction conditions, we
subsequently turned our attention to examining the substrate
scope with respect to a variety of arylidenoxindoles. As shown
in Table 2, the corresponding cyclization products 3 were
generally obtained in high yields (71−98%) with good
enantioselectivities (76−90% ee) (Table 2, entries 1−13).
Substrates containing strong electron-withdrawing groups at
the para positions of the benzene rings of 1 exhibited higher
reactivities (1e and 1f). A larger aromatic ring could also be
accommodated in the reaction, giving good yield and excellent
enantioselectivity (Table 2, entry 14). When the substrates
were heterocyclic rings (1n and 1o), the [4+2] cycloaddition
could also work; however,
lower yields and moderate
enantioselectivities were obtained (Table 2, entrise 15 and
16). To our disappointment, when R1 is an ester or aliphatic
group (1p and 1q), corresponding cyclization products 3p and
3q were obtained with low yields and bad enantioselectivities

(Table 2, entries 17 and 18). Higher yields and ee values could
also be achieved when 5- or 6-chloro-substituted (E)-tert-butyl
3-benzylidene-2-oxindoline-1-carboxylate (1r or 1s,
respec-
tively) was introduced to the substrates (Table 2, entry 19 or
20, respectively). Further examination of
the N-protecting
group of oxindole shows that 1t and 1u can also work in this
cyclization reactions smoothly with good ee values (Table 2,
entries 21 and 22, respectively). When R3 is a benzyl group,
[4+2] cycloaddition product 3v was isolated in an almost
racemic fashion in very low yield.15

To explore the substrate scope of the [4+2] cycloaddition,

zwitterion homoenolate then may preferentially attack from
the re face to minimize the steric repulsion. The inferior

In summary, we have developed an asymmetric [4+2]
cycloaddition reaction of allenoates with 3-oleﬁnic oxindoles
catalyzed by tertiary amine type Lewis base. Remarkably, in the
presence of a commercially available catalyst, β-ICD, a wide
range of 3-arylidenoxindoles and substituted allenoates under-
went
the reaction smoothly, providing a number of
dihydropyran-fused indole derivatives in good yields (up to
98%), excellent regioselectivities (>20:1), and good enantiose-
lectivities (up to 94% ee).

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Information. Commercial reagents were used as received,
unless otherwise stated. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a
400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in parts per
million from tetramethylsilane with the solvent resonance as the
internal standard. The following abbreviations were used to designate
chemical shift mutiplicities: s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, quartet;
m, multiplet. All ﬁrst-order splitting patterns were assigned on the
basis of the appearance of the multiplet. Splitting patterns that could
not be easily interpreted were designated as multiplet (m). Mass
spectra were obtained using electrospray ionization (ESI-TOF),
electron impact
ionization (EI-TOF), or matrix-assisted laser
desorption ionization (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. 3-Oleﬁnic
oxindoles were synthesized according to the literature procedure.18

dure. To a stirred solution of (E)-tert-butyl 3-benzylidene-2-
oxindoline-1-carboxylate 1a (0.1 mmol) and β-ICD (0.02 mmol) in
dry CHCl3 (0.5 mL) at −30 °C was added ethyl 2,3-butadienoate 2a
(0.15 mmol, 1.5 equiv). The reactions were monitored by TLC. After
1a was consumed, the reaction solution was concentrated in vacuo and
the crude was puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography to aﬀord product 3a.
The regioselectivity was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy of the
crude product. The ee value was determined by chiral HPLC analysis.

(13) Shi and Ye reported the achiral version of
this reaction,
independently. However, the asymmetric catalysis of this reaction has
not been reported until now: (a) Chen, X.-Y.; Wen, M.-W.; Ye, S.;
Wang, Z.-X. Org. Lett. 2011, 13, 1138. (b) Zhang, X.-C.; Cao, S.-H.;

(14) During the preparation of the manuscript, Shi reported a chiral
amine-catalyzed cycloaddition between allenoates and acylidenox-
indoles, which results in the construction of bioxindole-substituted
hexahydrofuro[2,3-b]furans. See: Yang, H.-B.; Zhao, Y.-Z.; Sang, R.;
Wei, Y.; Shi, M. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2014, 356, 3799.
(15) When R3 = H, only trace product was achieved. It is suggested
that the protecting groups (especially for the electron-withdrawing
groups) are necessary for the reaction.
(16) When 4-substituted derivatives of allenoates (e.g., methyl 5-
phenylpenta-2,3-dienoate and ethyl penta-2,3-dienoate) were selected
as substrates, no [4+2] cycloaddtion products were isolated.
