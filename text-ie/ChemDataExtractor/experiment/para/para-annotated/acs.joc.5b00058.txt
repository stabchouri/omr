ABSTRACT: A metal-free cyclization reaction of 2-isocyanobiphenyls with amide derivatives by using tert-butyl peroxybenzoate
(TBPB) as oxidant was developed, which provided an access to pharmacologically interesting 6-amidophenanthridine
compounds. The reactions proceeded through a sequence of functionalization of the C(sp3)−H bond adjacent to the nitrogen
atom and intramolecular radical aromatic cyclization with good chemistry yields.

■ INTRODUCTION
The direct functionalization of a C(sp3)−H bond to form a new
C−C bond provides a potent strategic approach for the
synthesis of complex molecules, which is also a great challenge
due to their high bond dissociation energy and low polarity.1
Over the past several years, the groups of Li and others have
developed many methodologies on transition-metal-catalyzed
cross-dehydrogenative-coupling (CDC) reactions of sp3 C−H
to form C−C bonds.2 Especially, metal-catalyzed
bonds
functionalization of C(sp3)−H bonds adjacent to heteroatoms
represents a hot topic and considerable eﬀorts have been
devoted to this ﬁeld.3 By this strategy diverse functional groups,
such as indole, benzofuran, alkyne, alkene, cyano, and enol
ether, were introduced to couple with the carbon adjacent to a
nitrogen or oxygen atom.4 Recently, we also reported an iron-
catalyzed cross-dehydrogenative coupling for C(sp2)−C(sp3)
bond formation with ethers as radical precursors.5 Very
recently, the Lee group developed palladium(II)-/copper(II)-
catalyzed arylation of an sp3 C−H bond adjacent to oxygen
with phenol and naphthol derivatives.6 Gaunt and coauthors
explored palladium-catalyzed C−H activation of aliphatic
amines to give strained nitrogen heterocycles with PhI(OAc)2
as the oxidant.7 Although considerable advances in this ﬁeld
have been achieved, the eﬃcient and versatile strategies for
C(sp3)−H bond functionalization under metal-free conditions
is a more challenging task and is highly desirable.8 Several
groups have reported metal-free C(sp3)−H bond functionaliza-
tion by cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reactions.9
Very recently, our group also reported a metal-free oxidative
C(sp3)−H bond functionalization of alkanes and alkylation-
initiated radical 1,2-aryl migration of α,α-diaryl allylic alcohols

using di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP) as the oxidant.10 However,
examples of direct C−H bond oxidative functionalization
adjacent to an amide nitrogen under metal-free conditions are
still scarce. Until now, only a few elegant examples were
reported by the Li and Patel groups on sp3 C−H bond
functionalization adjacent to a nitrogen atom in an amide and
the following reaction with disulﬁdes, alkenes, and alkynes.11
Aryl isonitriles, which could directly construct phenanthri-
dine derivatives by a cascade reaction, have attracted much
attention in the synthetic community. The resulting phenan-
thridine derivatives also belong to an important class of
biological compounds and widely exist in natural products.12
Furthermore, the Pierre group recently developed a molecular
probe for the luminescent detection of adenosine nucleotides,
which bears a 6-amidophenanthridine moiety as the key
fragment (Scheme 1).13

Scheme 2. Methods for the Preparation of 6-Amidophenanthridine Derivatives

The groups of Studer and others have explored several
radical precursors to react with isonitriles for construction of
phenanthridine, such as boronic acids,
triﬂuoromethylation
reagents, halides, aldehydes, diphenylphosphine oxide, α-
oxocarboxylic acids, hydrazines, aryl sulfonyl chlorides, alcohols,
ethers, and alkanes.14 Very recently, our group also developed a
metal-free cyclization of isocyanides with disulﬁdes via S−S
bond cleavage.15 Although 2-isocyanobiphenyls are known to
react with many radicals, the use of 2-isocycanobiphenyls as an
acceptor
to construct 6-
amidophenanthridines has never been reported. As mentioned
in Scheme 2a, a previous method in preparing 6-amidophenan-
thridines generally involves several palladium-catalyzed reac-
tions and light-promoted conditions (eight steps). Herein, we
report the ﬁrst example of the cascade functionalization of a
C(sp3)−H bond adjacent to an amide nitrogen atom and
intramolecular aromatic cyclization under metal-free conditions
(Scheme 2b).

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
To examine the reactivity of amides, we chose DMAc (N,N-
dimethylacetamide, 2a) as a model substrate to react with 2-
isocyanobiphenyl (1a), as shown in Table 1. We conducted the
reaction of 2-isocyanobiphenyl (1a) with DMAc (2 mL) in the
presence of 2.0 equiv of DTBP at 120 °C for 24 h, which gave
the expected product of 6-amidophenanthridines (3a) in a low
yield (31%, Table 1, entry 1). Increasing the amount of oxidant
DTBP to 3 equiv resulted in an obviously higher yield (51%,
entry 2). Attempts to use transition metals, such as FeCl3,
CuBr2, and CuBr, as the catalysts were unsuccessful, resulting in
almost no product (entries 3−5). Cu2O was also tried as a
catalyst in the reaction, and no improvement was found (entry
6). Further optimization attempts led us to use other oxidants,
including BPO, TBPB, DCP, and TBHP. The reaction could
not happen with the use of BPO as oxidant, and almost all of
the starting material remained (entry 7). When the reaction was
performed in the presence of TBPB, the target product was
obtained in a dramatically higher yield of 87% (entry 8). DCP
and TBHP could also promote the reaction to give the desired
product in moderate yields (34% and 61%, respectively, entries
9 and 10).

nitrogen atom. As shown in Scheme 3, DMAc (2a) could react
with varieties of 2-isocyanobiphenyl (1) to give the expected
product in good to excellent chemical yields (63−87%). This
reaction could bear several substituents at diﬀerent positions on
the aromatic ring withthe isocyano group, including methoxy
(3b), methyl (3k), chloro (3f), and ﬂuoro (3d,l), giving almost
the same level of yields. This brief screening discloses that the
electronic properties and steric hindrance have no noticeable
eﬀect on the reaction eﬃciency. A substrate containing two
substituted groups (methyl) on the aromatic ring also worked
well, giving the corresponding product in 67% yield (3e). A
further substrate scope study was performed to investigate the
eﬀect of substituents on the cyclized aromatic ring. All of the
reactions could also proceed smoothly, aﬀording the expected
product in good yields, even for a strongly electron donating
group (MeO, 3g) and a strongly electron withdrawing group (F
and CF3, 3h,j). Finally, the more highly sterically hindered

As a continuation of this study on the radical cyclization
reaction, we focused on exploring the generality of
these
reactions bearing the variation in the amide substrates (Scheme
4). First, we used monomethyl-substituted acetamide as a
substrate to check the reaction eﬃciency. The reaction did
happen and gave the desired product in 31% yield (3o) with
excellent chemoselectivity. This result showed that the key
fragment of the molecular probe (Scheme 1, (a) and (b)) could
be directly synthesized in one step from simple starting
materials, although the yield was not satisﬁed. It is noteworthy
that N,N-dimethylpropionamide also worked in this reaction

■ CONCLUSION

To conclude, we showed that amide easily undergoes an
oxidative radical reaction with 2-isocyanobiphenyl derivatives in
the presence of TBPB. It involves new C(sp2)−C(sp2) and
C(sp3)−C(sp2) bond formation in one step via C(sp3)−H
bond functionalization and an intramolecular cyclization
process. The reactions show wide generality and good chemical
yields, providing an easy way to prepare 6-amidophenanthri-
dine derivatives.
