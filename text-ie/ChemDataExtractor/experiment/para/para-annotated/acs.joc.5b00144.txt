ABSTRACT: A copper-mediated triﬂuoromethylthiolation of
vinyl bromides has been developed. This method provides
ready access to vinyl triﬂuoromethyl thioethers in good to high
yields from simple,
inexpensive starting materials. A broad
substrate scope is achieved, and the reaction is compatible with
various functional groups,
triﬂuor-
omethyl, alkoxy, amino, halide, and heterocyclic groups.

F luorine containing compounds are ubiquitous in pharma-
ceuticals, agrochemicals, and advanced materials.1,2 Their
ﬂuorine moieties oﬀer unusual chemical and physical properties,
which can profoundly enhance the biological activity and
metabolic stability.3,4 The triﬂuoromethylthio group (CF3S−)
interest, as it has one of the highest Hansch
is of special
hydrophobicity parameter values (π
R = 1.44).5 As a consequence,
great synthetic eﬀorts have been exerted to develop eﬃcient
methods for the incorporation of the CF3S− group into organic
molecules.6−11 In particular,
transition-metal-catalyzed or
-mediated triﬂuoromethylthiolation have experienced impressive
progress and growth in recent years. For instance, Cu-catalyzed
and -mediated triﬂuoromethylthiolation of aryl12−14 and alkyl
boronic acids,15 aryl halides,16 and arenediazonium salts,17
related Cu-18−20 and Pd-promoted21 triﬂuoromethylthiolation
through the direct functionalization of C−H bonds, Ag-catalyzed
decarboxylative triﬂuoromethylthiolation of aliphatic carboxylic
acids,22 and Pd-23 and Ni-catalyzed triﬂuoromethylthiolation of
aryl halides24 have provided attractive access to compounds
−SCF3 bonds.
bearing Csp2
However, synthetic processes for the direct construction of
−SCF3 bonds via transition-metal-catalyzed or -mediated
Cvinyl
triﬂuoromethylthiolation have not been well developed (Scheme
1). The Vicic,13 Shen,25 and Rueping14 groups independently
reported Cu-mediated and -catalyzed triﬂuoromethylthiolation
of vinyl boronic acids to form vinyl triﬂuoromethyl thioethers.
Most recently, Rueping and co-workers also developed a Cu-
catalyzed triﬂuoromethylthiolation of vinyl iodides.26 However,
many of these procedures often require vinylboron compounds
or vinyl iodides as substrates and/or the use of an electrophilic
type triﬂuoromethylthiolation reagent.

We have therefore sought to develop a highly facile and cost-
eﬀective route to vinyl triﬂuoromethyl thioethers via copper-
mediated triﬂuoromethylthiolation of vinyl bromides.

Copper-promoted coupling of vinyl bromides or iodides with
S-nucleophiles has proven to be a powerful method for the

synthesis of vinyl sulﬁdes.27−32 However, the coupling of vinyl
− to give vinyl triﬂuoromethyl thioether
bromides with SCF3
products is a challenging task because of
the reduced
nucleophilicity of the SCF3 anion.26
As part of our continuing studies on copper-mediated
triﬂuoromethylthiolation,33−38 we recently developed a novel
−SCF3 bond formation mediated by a copper(I) triﬂuoro-
Caryl
methylthiolate complex (bpy)Cu(SCF3) (2; bpy = 2,2′-
bipyridine).33 This complex reacted with various aryl iodides
or activated aryl bromides to aﬀord aryl
triﬂuoromethyl
thioethers in modest to excellent yields. These results encourage
us to probe the feasibility of performing the triﬂuoromethyl-
thiolation of more challenging substrates, such as vinyl bromides,
using the copper reagent 2.

some parameters such as the solvent and additive on the outcome
of the reaction. Other solvents, such as DMF, DMSO, and
dioxane, were also ineﬀective (Table 1, entries 2, 3, and 6). When
the solvent was changed to toluene and THF, the desired
product 3a was obtained in yields of 50% and 59%, respectively
(Table 1, entries 4, and 5). It was found that diglyme was an
optimal solvent, aﬀording 3a in 64% yield (Table 1, entry 7).
Thus, diglyme was chosen as a solvent of choice for further
studies. Since the addition of alkali metal ﬂuorides could
signiﬁcantly enhance the reaction eﬃciency probably by
facilitating the formation of an active intermediate,36,37 various
ﬂuorides were screened in the reaction (Table 1, entries 8−13). It
was found that KF was superior to all other screened additives for
the reaction (Table 1, entry 10). Increasing the quantity of KF
from 2 to 4 equiv resulted in a higher yield of 80% (Table 1, entry
14). The reaction time was also examined. The results indicated
that the yield of 3a increased from 80% to 92% when the reaction
time was prolonged from 16 to 24 h (Table 1, entry 15).

Subsequently, a comparison with other triﬂuoromethyl-
thiolation reagents was performed (Table 2). Reaction with
(phen)Cu(SCF3) (phen = phenanthroline) generated product
3a in moderate yield (55%; Table 2, entry 2). Similar behaviors
were also observed in the previously reported triﬂuoromethyl-
thiolation of aryl iodides.33 Moreover in the case of the Cu(I)
catalyzed triﬂuoromethylthiolation using the [Bu4N][SCF3]
reagent, the reaction produced a lower yield of 3a (30%; Table
2, entry 3). This result shows a higher reactivity of (bpy)Cu-
(SCF3) (2) compared to other reagents (Table 2, entry 1).

The generality of the reaction conditions was next tested on a

excellent yields. Moreover, no aryl acetylenes or homocoupled

15.0−15.4 Hz; cis conﬁguration: J = 10.6−10.7 Hz),
is in
accordance with the results obtained in closely related
molecules.13,25,26 It also is worth noting that
the E/Z
stereochemistry of the styrenyl triﬂuoromethyl thioether bond
corresponds to the starting vinyl bromide (Table 3, entries 1−
16).

<para sub="scope">
For example, phenylvinyl bromides 1a and 1b aﬀorded the
corresponding products 3a and 3b in 90% and 92% yields,
respectively (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). β-Bromostyrene having
electron-donating groups on the phenyl ring were successfully
converted to the desired products 3c−3f in good to high yields
(75%−93%; Table 3, entries 3−6). Furthermore, the introduc-
tion of electron-withdrawing substituents,
including cyano,
triﬂuoromethyl, and nitro groups, were well tolerated to give
3g−3j in good yields (76−81%; Table 3, entries 7−10). This
observation is consistent with our previous studies on triﬂuoro-
methylthiolation of α-halo-α,β-unsaturated carbonyl sub-
strates.36 Interestingly, the ﬂuoro and chloro groups at the
ortho-, meta-, or para-position of aromatic rings were also
tolerated and the respective products 3k−3o were aﬀorded in
62−85% yields (Table 3, entries 11−15). This method can be
further extended to the heteroarylvinyl bromide systems. The
reactions of (Z)-2-(2-bromovinyl)pyridine (1p) with 2 gave 3p
in 78% yield (Table 3, entry 16). Likewise, α-bromostyrene (1q)
could also be reactive under the standard reaction conditions,
leading to the desired product 3q in 73% yield (Table 3, entry
17). Moreover, even 2-bromo-1,1,2-triphenylethylene (1r), a
sterically highly demanding arylvinyl bromide, was a suitable
substrate providing good yield of product 3r (72%; Table 3, entry
18). Unfortunately, triﬂuoromethylthiolation of a cyclic vinyl
bromide 1s under the standard conditions was less eﬃcient,
producting a low yield of product 3s (23% of 19F NMR yield;
Table 3, entry 19), along with dehalogenated and other
unidentiﬁed side products. In addition to vinyl bromides,
nonconjugated vinyl iodides are also suitable for the reaction.
(1-Iodovinyl)cyclohexane (1t) and 2-iodooct-1-ene (1u) reacted
with 2 to deliver good yields of the desired products 3t and 3u
(70% and 61% of 19F NMR yields, respectively; Table 3, entries
20 and 21).

To demonstrate the scalability and practicability of our
synthesis, the triﬂuoromethylthiolation was conducted on a gram
scale. Using 1.0 g of 1a as the substrate, the triﬂuoromethyl-

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a copper-mediated
triﬂuoromethylthiolation of vinyl bromides that gives vinyl
triﬂuoromethyl thioethers in good to excellent yields. The
reaction demonstrates a broad substrate scope and a variety of
functional groups, including cyano, nitro, triﬂuoromethyl, alkoxy,
amino, halide, and heterocyclic groups that are tolerated. The
complete retention of the oleﬁn geometry, functional group
tolerance, and scalability of this reaction make it an attractive
protocol for the practical synthesis of these potentially important
molecules.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Methods. All manipulations were carried out under an
inert atmosphere using a nitrogen-ﬁlled glovebox or standard Schlenk
techniques. All glassware was oven or ﬂame-dried immediately prior to
use. Solvents were freshly dried and degassed according to the
procedures in Puriﬁcation of Laboratory Chemicals prior to use.
Deuterated solvents were purchased commercially and were degassed
and stored over activated 4 Å molecular sieves. β-Bromostyrene 1b−
iodides 1t−u,43 (bpy)Cu(SCF3), (phen)Cu-
o,40,41 1p,42 alkenyl
(SCF3),33 and [Bu4N][SCF3]44 were prepared according to the
published procedures. All other reagents were obtained from
commercial sources and used without further puriﬁcation. The 1H,
19F, and 13C{1H}NMR spectra were recorded at 400, 376, and 101 MHz,
respectively. 19F NMR chemical shifts were determined relative to
CFCl3 as the outside standard and low ﬁeld is positive. Mass
spectrometry was performed on a GC/MS spectrometer with the
electron impact (EI) ionization technique. HRMS data were recorded
on a GC-TOF instrument using the EI technique.

General Procedure for Triﬂuoromethylthiolation of Phenyl-
vinyl Bromide with (bpy)Cu(SCF3). Phenylvinyl bromide 1 (0.50
mmol), [(bpy)Cu(SCF3)] 2 (192 mg, 0.60 mmol, 1.2 equiv), KF (116
mg, 2.0 mmol), and diglyme (5.0 mL) were added to a reaction tube
with a Teﬂon screw cap equipped with a stir bar. The mixture was stirred
at 100 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was ﬁltered through a pad of
Celite. The ﬁltrate was added to water (10 mL) at 0 °C. The resulting
mixture was extracted with Et2O (3 × 15 mL), and the combined organic
layers was washed with water and then dried over MgSO4. The solvent
was removed by rotary evaporation in an ice bath, and the resulting
product was puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel with
pentane/Et2O.
