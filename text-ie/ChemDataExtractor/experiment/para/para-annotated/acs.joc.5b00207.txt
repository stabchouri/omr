ABSTRACT: A metal- and base-free protocol
for one-pot
synthesis of 2,5-diaryl 1,3,4-oxadiazoles via a radical-promoted
cross-dehydrogenative coupling strategy was developed. This
reaction involved the N-acylation of aryl tetrazoles with aryl
aldehydes, followed by thermal rearrangement. A wide range of
aryl tetrazoles and aryl aldehydes survived the reaction conditions to deliver the corresponding products in moderate to good
yields.

2,5-Diaryl 1,3,4-oxadiazoles are of great importance due to their
wide applications in pharmaceutical chemistry and material
science. They have shown a wide range of biological properties,
including antimicrobial, anti-inﬂammatory, anticonvulsant, and
antiviral properties.1 They are also useful surrogates of acids,
esters, and carboxamides.2 Moreover, their unique optoelec-
tronic properties make them particularly attractive in material
science.3

Traditionally, 2,5-diaryl 1,3,4-oxadiazoles were prepared via
the following methods (Scheme 1): (a) dehydrative cyclization

Scheme 1. Diﬀerent Pathways for Preparation of 2,5-
Disubstituted 1,3,4-Oxadiazoles

with these procedures. For example, a large excess amount of
corrosive reagents such as SOCl2, PPA, POCl3, and H2SO4 were
used in the dehydrative cyclization process (route a). For routes
b and c, substituted 1,3,4-oxadiazoles should be preformed as the
starting materials. Although oxidative cyclization of N-acylhy-
drazones attracted much attention due to its high atom-
economy, a metal catalyst as well as hazardous oxidants were
employed (route d). Compared with other methods,
the
Huisgen reaction is a facile approach to aﬀord the corresponding
2,5-disubstituted 1,3,4-oxadiazoles (route e). Initially, acylated
tetrazole is formed via N-acylation of tetrazole with a carboxylic
acid anhydride or acid chloride. A 1,5-dipole (nitrileimine) is
subsequently generated by elimination of nitrogen, followed by
cyclization, to provide the ﬁnal product (Scheme 2).8b While

substituted-5-trimethylsilyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole with electrophiles;5
(c) copper-mediated coupling reaction of aryl halides with
preformed 2-substituted 1,3,4-oxadiazole;6 (d) oxidative cycliza-
tion of N-acylhydrazones in the presence of various oxidizing
agents or catalysts;7 and (e) the Huisgen 1,3,4-oxadiazole
synthesis.8 However, there are still some limitations associated

acknowledging the pioneering work in this ﬁeld, some drawbacks
such as the use of relatively corrosive acylation reagents and base
additives are still the issues to be addressed.

Recently, the cross-dehydrogenative coupling (CDC) reac-
tions have attracted considerable attention.9 This strategy
provides a powerful tool to construct more complex compounds
with simple starting materials. In this context, we envisioned that,

if the acylated tetrazoles could be synthesized via direct coupling
reaction between 5-aryl-2H-tetrazoles and aldehydes, the 2,5-
disubstituted 1,3,4-oxadiazoles could then be generated via
thermal rearrangement. Meanwhile, high atom eﬃciency and
reduced waste could be achieved. Just recently, we realized the
alkylation of tetrazoles with methylarenes or alkyl ethers via
CDC reaction.10 Inspired by the results, herein, we report a
metal- and base-free, radical-promoted one-pot synthesis of 2,5-
diaryl 1,3,4-oxadiazoles.

peroxide, TBPB = tert-butyl peroxybenzoate, BPO = benzoyl peroxide,

obtained using di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP, 2 equiv) as oxidant
in acetonitrile (Table 1, entry 1). Replacing DTBP by other
peroxides such as tert-butyl peroxybenzoate (TBPB), benzoyl
peroxide (BPO), and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) aﬀorded the
corresponding product in poor yields (Table 1, entries 2−4).
Trace amounts of 3a were observed in the presence of tert-butyl
hydroperoxide (TBHP) and H2O2 (Table 1, entries 5 and 6).
The eﬀect of solvent on the model reaction was also surveyed
(Table 1, entries 7−14). Relatively lower yields were obtained
when the reaction took place in ethyl acetate or under solvent-
free conditions (20% and 27%, respectively). Reaction in other
solvents including DMF,
toluene, and dioxane gave trace
amounts of products, whereas no reaction was observed in
THF and DMSO. Encouragingly, a 70% yield of 3a was obtained
when the reaction was conducted in 1,2-dichloroethane. Further
prolonging the reaction time to 24 h aﬀorded the desired product

in 87% yield (Table 1, entry 15). Moreover,
increasing the
amount of DTBP to 3 equiv slightly decreased the yield, while
only 41% yield was obtained when 1 equiv of DTBP was
employed (Table 1, entries 16 and 17). Finally, the survey on the
reaction temperature and reaction atmosphere showed that 110
°C and air were the optimum (Table 1, entries 18−20).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
With these results in hand, we began to examine the scope and
generality of the present method (Table 2). Generally, most of
the aryl tetrazoles reacted with benzaldehyde smoothly to give
the desired products in moderate to good yields (3a−3g). For
the para-substituted tetrazoles, a series of functional groups such
as methyl, chloro, ﬂuoro, triﬂuoromethyl, and methoxyl survived
well under the reaction conditions. Among them, tetrazole
bearing electron-withdrawing group such as −F gave relatively
lower yield (3f, 43%). For para-hydroxyl substituted tetrazole,
only a trace amount of the desired product was detected (3n).
The steric hindrance showed negligible inﬂuence on the reaction,
aﬀording the products 3c and 3d in good yields (81% and 74%,
respectively). Finally, a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical
2,5-aryl 1,3,4-oxadiazoles were also obtained in good yields via
reactions between aryl tetrazoles and substituted aldehydes (3i−
3m).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
To further explore the scope of this protocol, a series of
aldehydes were then investigated. The results are summarized in
Table 3. To our delight, aryl aldehydes with various substituents
coupled with 5-phenyl-2H-tetrazole smoothly to aﬀord the
desired products in moderate to good yields. Various functional
groups including methyl, methoxyl, chloro, ﬂuoro,
triﬂuor-
omethyl, nitro, cyano, and methylthio groups survived the
reaction conditions. Aldehydes bearing strong electron-with-
drawing groups such as −CF3 and −NO2 gave relatively lower
yields (3g′, 50%; 3o, 30%), while 4-formylbenzonitrile showed
good reactivity to aﬀord product 3q in 89% yield. Obvious steric
hindrance inﬂuence was observed for ortho-substituted alde-
hydes, and moderate yields were obtained (3s, 48%; 3t, 51%; 3u,
46%, respectively). 1-Naphthaldehyde also showed good
reactivity to deliver 3v in 81% yield. Moreover, 4-hydrox-
ybenzaldehyde and furfural were inert, and only trace amounts of
products were observed. Some aliphatic aldehydes were also
checked (although they are not shown in Table 3); however, they
still gave poor results. This may be attributed to the fact that
these intermediates or starting materials are not stable under
such reaction conditions (see the mechanism).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
To gain insight into the mechanism, some control experiments
were conducted (Scheme 3). The reaction did not occur in the
absence of DTBP (Scheme 3, eq 1). When 2 equiv of radical
scavenger, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine N-oxide (TEMPO),
was added to the reaction mixture under standard conditions,
no desired product was obtained. Instead, the acylated TEMPO
was detected by HPLC-MS. This result indicated that an acyl
radical may be involved in this reaction (Scheme, eq 2). To rule
out the possibility that the reaction proceeded through direct
coupling of an acyl radical and nitrogen radical, we ran the
reaction in the absence of aldehyde. Expectedly, no coupling
product from tetrazole and TEMPO was observed (Scheme, eq
3). When benzoic acid or tert-butyl benzoperoxoate was used
instead of benzaldehyde, no product was detected, indicating that
these compounds were not intermediates (Scheme 3, eq 4). To
verify whether an acyl cation was formed in this reaction, a
control experiment was conducted by addition of methanol
under standard conditions. It was found that methyl esters could
be formed in 17% yield (Scheme 3, eq 5).

On the basis of these experimental results and literature,11 a
possible mechanism is proposed in Scheme 4. Initially, homolytic
cleavage of DTBP produces tert-butoxy radical. This radical
abstracts one H atom of aldehyde to form A, which is further
oxidized by another tert-butoxy radical to form acyl cation B.
Then, a nucleophilic reaction of tetrazole to B under the
assistance of tert-butoxy anion provides the acylated tetrazole C.
Finally, thermal decomposition of C aﬀords the desired product
3.

In conclusion, a radical-promoted direct coupling of aryl
tetrazoles with aldehydes, followed by thermal rearrangement to
generate 2,5-diaryl 1,3,4-oxadiazoles, has been developed. This
protocol provides a simple approach for the preparation of 1,3,4-
oxadiazole derivatives. A series of functional groups survived the
reaction conditions to give the corresponding products in
moderate to good yields.

General Information. Chemicals were used as received without
special puriﬁcation unless stated otherwise. 1H and 13C NMR were
recorded at ambient temperature on a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer.
NMR experiments are reported in δ units, parts per million (ppm), and
were referenced to CDCl3 (δ 7.26 or 77.0 ppm) as the internal standard.
The coupling constants J are given in Hz. Melting points (mp) are
determined with an MPA 100 apparatus and are not corrected. High-
resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed on a TOF MS
instrument with an ESI source.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 2,5-Diaryl 1,3,4-
oxadiazoles. A sealed tube equipped with a magnetic stir bar was
charged with aryl tetrazole (0.50 mmol), aryl aldehyde (1.0 mmol), di-

tert-butyl-peroxide (1.0 mmol, 146 mg), and 1,2-dichloroethane (3.0
mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 24 h. After reaction,
the reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature. The
solvent was then removed under vacuum, and the residue was puriﬁed
by silica gel chromatography using a mixture of PE/EA to aﬀord the
desired product 3.
