ABSTRACT: A highly stereoselective construction of 2,6-cis-disubstituted tetrahy-
dropyrans was achieved by using an intramolecular amide enolate alkylation with
KHMDS. The eﬃciency and practicality of this methodology was successfully
demonstrated in the total synthesis of (−)-centrolobine (1).

2,6-cis-Disubstituted tetrahydropyran (THP) ring systems
constitute key structural features in a wide range of biologically
active natural products such as SCH 351448,1 chamuvarinin,2
and centrolobine (1).3 Although several strategies have been
the construction of 2,6-cis-disubstituted
developed for
THPs,4−6 there is
still a need for an eﬃcient, highly
stereoselective and high yielding approach to this core unit.

Intramolecular enolate alkylation has frequently been utilized
the synthesis of natural products that contain small
for
tetrahydrofurans, and medium-ring oxacycles,7
carbocycles,
but no reports have yet appeared wherein this methodology
was employed to construct THP moieties in natural products.
Only a few substituted THP systems have been synthesized by
utilizing intramolecular enolate alkylation.8−11 When α-
alkoxyesters were treated with LDA, substituted THPs were
generated in moderate to good yield, except
for a 2,6-
disubstituted case. Contrary to 2,2,6-trisubstituted THP
systems, the eﬃcient generation of 2,6-disubstituted THPs
was elusive, even in the presence of HMPA.8 We considered
that the poor conversion could be attributed to instability of the
ester enolate, and that this problem might be overcome by
replacing the ester group with an amide, since amide enolates
have been more stable than ester enolates in our experience.
We report herein the feasibility of using intramolecular amide
enolate alkylation (IAEA) for the construction of 2,6-cis-
disubstituted THP systems, with particular emphasis on the
stereochemical outcome. This report also describes a total
synthesis of (−)-centrolobine (1), which demonstrates the
practicality of IAEA.

When LiHMDS or NaHMDS was used instead of LDA, the
reaction yield improved to a great extent but
the stereo-
selectivity decreased (Table 1, entries 2 and 3). However, THP
cis-8a was produced with excellent stereoselectivity (cis/trans,
20:1) in high yield when tosylate 7a in THF was treated with
potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (KHMDS) (Table 1, entry
4). The cyclization was also attempted in the presence of
HMPA to improve the reaction, but in vain (Table 1, entries 5
and 6). The results suggest that adequate coordination of metal
ions with enolates
for high stereoselectivity.
Treatment of tosylate 7a with an excess of KHMDS decreased
both the reaction yield and the stereoselectivity (Table 1, entry
7). IAEA of tosylate 7a with KHMDS was also performed in
other solvents, but neither the yield nor the stereoselectivity for
this cyclization improved (Table 1, entries 8−10). The relative
stereochemistry of the cyclized products trans-8a and cis-8a
was elucidated through analysis of
the NOESY spectra.
Tosylates 7b,c were also prepared from the corresponding
diols 2b,c13 following the same procedure as for 7a. When
these substrates 7b,c were subjected to IAEA with KHMDS as a
base, cis-8b,c were also obtained with excellent stereoselectivity
in high yield, respectively (Table 1, entries 11 and 12). The
observed stereoselectivity can be best
rationalized by
considering that the reaction proceeds via the folding and
allylic strain-controlled14 chairlike transition state geometry TS-
A in which the nucleophilic amide enolate moiety assumes an
“H-eclipsed” conformation with the bulky R group in an
equatorial position,
to aﬀord a 2,6-cis-disubstituted THP
product (Figure 1). The high cis stereoselectivity of the IAEA
is also quite surprising compared to the precedent of
intramolecular ester enolate alkylation for the construction of
2,6-substituted THPs, although other appendages on these

THP systems might aﬀect the stereoselectivity to some extent.
Treatment of an α-alkoxyester of 1,2,5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-
D-allofuranose with LDA produced a 2,6-substituted tetrahy-
dropyran as a mixture of isomers with poor stereoselectivity
(cis/trans, ca. 54:30) in moderate yield.9 The 2,6-trans-
substituted tetrahydropyran moiety of 2-deoxy-β-KDO was
speciﬁcally generated via internal ester enolate SN2 alkylation.10

We then turned our attention to the asymmetric total
synthesis of a natural product, (−)-centrolobine (1),6 to prove
the synthetic utility of this methodology. In spite of its relatively
simple chemical structure, (−)-centrolobine (1) and related
compounds have attracted considerable attention due to their
diverse bioactivity,
including anti-inﬂammatory, antibacterial,
and antileishmanial properties.3,15 We envisioned that the THP
cis-10, a precursor of the well-known key intermediate 96a,c for
the synthesis of 1, could be constructed from tosylate 11 using
IAEA. The requisite IAEA substrate 11 was prepared from
readily available chiral alcohol 12,6e,r as outlined in Scheme 2.

General Procedure for Cyclization of Tosylate 7a−c (GP4).
To a solution of tosylate 7a (50.0 mg, 0.13 mmol) in anhydrous THF
(13.0 mL) was added dropwise KHMDS (0.3 mL, 0.15 mmol, 0.5 M
in THF) at −78 °C under a N2 atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at
the same temperature for 5 min. The mixture was warmed to −30 °C
immediately and stirred at this temperature for 11 h. The reaction
mixture was quenched with saturated aqueous NH4Cl, and
concentrated in vacuo. The residue was diluted with water and
extracted with EtOAc thrice. The combined organic layers were
washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The
resulting residue was puriﬁed by ﬂash column chromatography on
silica gel (hexanes/EtOAc, 10:1) to give cis-8a (24.0 mg, colorless oil,
82%) along with trans-8a (1.2 mg, colorless oil, 4%).
