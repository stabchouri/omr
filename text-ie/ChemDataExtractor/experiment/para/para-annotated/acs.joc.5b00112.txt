ABSTRACT: A series of 2-(3′-indolyl)tetrahydrofurans have been
prepared by a DDQ-mediated oxidative cycloetheriﬁcation process.
Performing the reaction under biphasic conditions prevents reductive
cleavage of the products by the spent oxidant (DDQH2).

T he Yonemitsu oxidation is the DDQ-mediated function-

alization of alkyl groups at the C3 position of the indole
nucleus (Scheme 1).1 Subjecting a 3-alkylindole 1 to DDQ

Scheme 1. Yonemitsu Oxidation

generates α,β-unsaturated iminium ion 2, which, under aqueous
conditions, undergoes attack at the β-position by water to give
an intermediate alcohol that, upon oxidation by a second
equivalent of DDQ, aﬀords ketone 3.2 A variant1c of this
process involves exposing acylated tryptamines (4; R = H) and
tryptophans (4; R = CO2P) to DDQ under anhydrous
conditions, with the resulting iminium ion undergoing
intramolecular cyclization, followed by aromatization to give
5-(3′-indolyl)oxazoles 5,3 a structural motif present in several
natural products.4
<para sub=“ques”>
In the course of our quest to discover small molecules that
selectively inhibit the pyruvate kinase (PK) of MRSA,5 we
sought a synthetic route to cyclic ether analogues of the natural
products 8−10, selective inhibitors of this enzyme.6 It was
planned that a series of indole-3-butanols 6 would undergo a
DDQ-mediated oxidative cycloetheriﬁcation7,8 to form 2-(3′-
indolyl)tetrahydrofurans 7,9 a study that would provide the
desired analogues but also represent a novel application of the
Yonemitsu oxidation (Scheme 2).
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
Initially,

the synthesis of 2-(3′-indolyl)tetrahydrofuran
(±)-7a by the oxidative cycloetheriﬁcation of indole-3-butanol
(6a)10 was attempted. Encouraging early results showed that
DDQ promoted the conversion of 6a to (±)-7a under a variety
of conditions, albeit in low yield. Although a detailed overview
is not provided herein, an extensive optimization study never
uncovered conditions that gave (±)-7a in yields above 20%
(Scheme 3). However, a recurring result throughout these
studies was the consistently good recovery of the starting
material 6a.
</para>
<para sub=“ques”>
A possible explanation for the results outlined in Scheme 3
was that the C2−O bond in (±)-7a was being reductively
cleaved by the spent oxidant (DDQH2; Scheme 4A). Subjecting
pure (±)-7a to DDQH2 in THF gave 6a in good yield at 60 °C
(Scheme 4B), proving that the desired product does indeed
undergo reductive cleavage. We are not aware of any reports
detailing the use of hydroquinones to eﬀect reductive cleavage
−O bonds, a process that is more commonly performed
of Csp3
using hydrogenolytic11 or dissolving metal12 conditions, with
lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride-Et3B13 and trialkylsi-
lanes14 also eﬀective.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
With this knowledge at hand, an obvious strategy would be
to remove the DDQH2 as it is formed during the reaction. By
conducting the reaction under biphasic conditions using a basic
aqueous component, the DDQH2 would enter the aqueous
phase as it is formed, and thus, the reductive cleavage of the
product would be prevented. Table 1 outlines our eﬀorts in this
regard. Subjecting 6a to DDQ in a biphasic solvent mixture of
dichloromethane and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate in
the presence of the phase transfer catalyst tetrabutylammonium
iodide (TBAI) gave a 28% yield of the product (±)-7a (entry
1), which could be increased by raising the temperature to
reﬂux (entry 2). A noticeable improvement in yield occurred
upon changing the organic solvent to 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-

reduction of the resulting ketones 12b−f (Table 2). This
methodology can be used to access 2-(3′-indolyl)tetrahydro-
furans with a variety of substituents at the 5-position of the
THF ring,
including alkyl (entry 2), aryl (entry 3), alkenyl

products (±)-7b−f were all formed as an inseparable mixture of

</para>
To conclude, a DDQ-mediated oxidative cycloetheriﬁcation
of indole-3-butanols to 2-(3′-indolyl)tetrahydrofurans has been
developed. Reductive cleavage of the products by DDQH2 can
be avoided by performing the reaction under biphasic
conditions. These results constitute a novel application of the
Yonemitsu oxidation, and the biphasic oxidation conditions
reported herein should ﬁnd utility in any DDQ-mediated
synthetic transformation that is hindered by the spent oxidant.

Procedures.

General Procedure A − Grignard Addition. To a solution of Weinreb
amide 8 in THF at 0 °C was added the appropriate Grignard reagent,
and the resulting solution was stirred at the quoted temperature for the
time stated. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (20 mL)
and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 25 mL), and the combined
organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4), ﬁltered, and concentrated in
vacuo. The crude residue was puriﬁed via column chromatography
eluting with the solvent(s) stated to give the ketone product.

General Procedure B − LiAlH4 Reduction. To a solution of ketone
in THF at 0 °C was added LiAlH4 (1 M in THF), and the reaction was
stirred at this temperature for the time stated. Ethyl acetate (1 mL)
was slowly added, followed by water (1 mL), and the reaction mixture
was poured onto a saturated aqueous solution of Rochelle’s salt (10
mL). The whole was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL), and the
combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), ﬁltered, and
concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was puriﬁed via column
chromatography eluting with the solvent(s) stated to give the reduced
product.

General Procedure C − Oxidative Cycloetheriﬁcation. A mixture
of cyclization precursor, dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone
(DDQ) and tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) in a 2:1 mixture of
1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE) and saturated aqueous sodium hydro-
gen carbonate solution was heated to 80 °C and stirred vigorously at
this temperature for the time stated. The reaction mixture was poured
onto a solution of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (20
mL), and ethyl acetate (30 mL) was added. The mixture was then
washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (6 × 40
mL), and the organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), ﬁltered, and
concentrated in vacuo. The crude mixture was puriﬁed via column
chromatography eluting with the solvent(s) stated to give the desired
2-(3′-indolyl)tetrahydrofuran as an inseparable mixture of cis- and
trans-diastereomers in the case of 7b−f.
