ABSTRACT: A method has been developed for the introduction of
nonaromatic heterocyclic structures onto aryl and heteroaryl bromides using
alkyl tosylates in a reductive cross-coupling manifold. This protocol oﬀers an
improvement over previous methods by utilizing alkyl tosylate coupling
partners that are bench-stable, crystalline solids that can be prepared from
inexpensive, commercially available alcohols.

R ecently, reductive cross-coupling protocols have garnered

a signiﬁcant amount of attention as a means of forming
C−C bonds without the necessity for generation of an organo-
metallic reagent.1 Although several methods have been
developed for the introduction of nonaromatic heterocycles
onto arenes,2 a particularly attractive route involves the direct
reductive coupling between nonaromatic heterocyclic halides
and (hetero)aryl halides that forges the sp3−sp2 linkage.3
Unlike earlier methods, these reductive protocols allow the
desired transformation to be carried out in a single step and
tolerate a variety of functional groups (Scheme 1). As one
example of
such eﬀorts, medicinal
chemistry programs continue to struggle to incorporate
nonaromatic heterocycles during SAR investigations, and
new methods that enable more complex functional group
arrays will extend the scope of matter in attractive physical
property space.

the importance of

Although the previously reported methods of Gong et al.3c
(Scheme 1A) and Molander et al.3d (Scheme 1B) increase the
eﬃciency in the installation of nonaromatic heterocycles onto
arenes by eliminating the need for a low-yielding metalation
step, the cost and availability of the nonaromatic, heterocyclic
halides may still be prohibitive in some cases. An improvement
of this protocol was envisioned in which less expensive alkyl
coupling partners could be used to eﬀect the desired trans-
formation. Notably, the alcohols of nitrogen- and oxygen-
containing nonaromatic heterocycles are signiﬁcantly less
expensive than the corresponding bromides and iodides.4 The
alcohols can be easily converted to the nonaromatic hetero-
cyclic tosylates,5 which are stable, colorless, crystalline solids at
room temperature, compared to the corresponding bromides,
many of which were liquids or gummy solids that became
discolored after a few weeks even when refrigerated.6

aryl and alkyl bromides.7 An example was illustrated in which a
nonaromatic heterocyclic tosylate was coupled with cyclohexyl
bromide in good yield (eq 1).

Recent work by Gong et al. demonstrated the Ni-catalyzed
reductive methylation of alkyl halides with methyl tosylate.8
Among the substrates were select N-containing nonaromatic
heterocyclic bromides (eq 2).

A general, functional group-tolerant method was therefore
pursued that would allow the reductive cross-coupling of a variety
of nonaromatic heterocyclic tosylates with aryl and heteroaryl
halides. A protocol was envisioned for this transformation based
on previous work in the area of Ni-catalyzed reductive cross-
coupling of saturated heterocyclic substructures.3d

Optimization of the targeted transformation was initiated on
the cross-coupling of tert-butyl 4-(tosyloxy)piperidine-1-carboxylate
with N-Boc-5-bromoindole (eq 3).

A similar approach was developed by Liu et al., who developed
a Cu-catalyzed cross-coupling of unactivated alkyl tosylates with

Under previously developed conditions, 1-Boc-4-bromo-
piperidine had been successfully cross-coupled with N-Boc-5-
bromoindole in the presence of catalytic NiI2 and MgCl2 as
an additive. Under this protocol, the reaction of
tert-butyl
4-(tosyloxy)piperidine-1-carboxylate with N-Boc-5-bromoindole
led to the formation of the desired cross-coupled product in
addition to nearly equal amounts of biaryl homocoupling and
protodehalogenation of the indole substrate (eq 4). Unreacted
alkyl tosylate remained, but no Boc-cleavage was observed on
any of the reaction components. Upon application of these
conditions to several aryl and heteroaryl bromides, these major
side products were formed to a signiﬁcant extent in every case.

optimization revealed that addition of 1 equiv of KI signiﬁcantly
improved conversion to the cross-coupled product, as did an
increase in reaction temperature from 60 to 80 °C. The amount

and tetrahydrofuranyl tosylate systems participated in the cross-
coupling. It was observed that the corresponding mesylates
of the tetrahydrofuranyl and piperidinyl systems reacted under
the standard conditions, albeit in lower yields (Table 1, entries
1 and 3). Unfortunately, both azetidine and oxetane substrates
were unreactive under the standard protocol, and the use of aryl
chlorides instead of aryl bromides led to minimal product
formation. Interestingly, under the conditions developed for
nonaromatic, heterocyclic systems, cyclohexyl

unreactive.

tional groups in addition to ortho-substitution. The scalable

carry out a gram-scale reaction without a decrease in the yield

In conclusion, a method has been developed for

the
reductive cross-coupling of nonaromatic, heterocyclic tosylates

the coupling partners are also employed.1b This
ratios of

cross-coupling protocols between nonaromatic, heterocyclic

Although the mechanism of

this reaction has not been
investigated, it is possible that KI serves to generate an alkyl
iodide in situ from the corresponding alkyl tosylate. Notably,
other metal halides, e.g. CsI, LiI, and KBr, served as suitable
additives for the given transformation, albeit leading to lower
product conversion. Based on a previously proposed mecha-
nistic pathway for reductive cross-coupling reactions,1c once
formed, the nonaromatic, heterocyclic halide could serve as a
source of alkyl radicals, which would then combine with an
Ar−Ni(II)−Br complex generated from the oxidative addition of
the aryl bromide to Ni(0). Reductive elimination from the newly
generated diorgano-Ni(III) species would provide the cross-
coupled product and a Ni(I) species that would be reduced to
Ni(0) by Mn.

<para sub="scope">
The concept of in situ sulfonate/halogen exchange has been
proposed in the Ni-catalyzed reductive methylation of alkyl
halides with methyl tosylate8 and in Ni-catalyzed dimeriza-
tions of alkyl pseudohalides.9 Although the latter contribution
employs NaI as an additive, the former (eq 2) uses no obvious
source of nucleophilic halide and there is no speculation on
the proposed pathway for alkyl halide formation. It has been
suggested that in instances where reactive alkyl halides undergo
rapid dimerization in the presence of Ni catalysts, their slow
formation from a less reactive species, i.e., alkyl mesylate or
tosylate, may be advantageous.8,10 In our hands, N-Boc-4-
iodopiperidine was never observed in the analytical sampling of
the crude reaction mixture. Additionally, under the developed
reductive coupling conditions, N-Boc-4-iodopiperidine in place
of the corresponding tosylate was unreactive with or without
the KI additive.11 If the alkyl iodide is, in fact, only a capable
coupling partner when formed in low concentration and rapidly
consumed, these observations can be rationalized. However, the
use of alkyl iodides did not lead to formation of an alkyl−alkyl
dimer or radical disproportionation products, which would be
predicted if rapid radical
formation were problematic. Fur-
thermore, the reaction also proceeds to some extent in the
absence of KI.12 These observations bring to question the
possibility of alkyl iodide formation as the sole function of KI
within the process and suggest that perhaps the iodide additive
plays a more complex role,1b,13 possibly in stabilization of a
transient nickel complex that facilitates reductive elimination
in the catalytic cycle or as a bridging ligand that facilitates
electron transfer.

Experimental Procedure. An oven-dried Biotage 10 mL
microwave vial equipped with a magnetic stirbar was charged with
·glyme (0.025 mmol, 7.7 mg), 4,4′-di-
alkyl tosylate (0.5 mmol), NiBr2
tert-butyl-2,2′-bipyridine (0.025 mmol, 6.7 mg), KI (0.5 mmol,
83.0 mg), and Mn powder (1.0 mmol, 55.0 mg). The vial was sealed
with a disposable Teﬂon septum cap and was evacuated and purged
with Ar three times. Dimethylacetamide (2.5 mL) and 4-ethylpyridine
(0.5 mmol, 54 mg) were added via syringe, followed by the (hetero)aryl
bromide (0.5 mmol). In cases where the (hetero)aryl bromide was a
solid, it was added to the vial along with the other solids. The reaction
was stirred under Ar at 80 °C for 18 h, after which the solution was
cooled and diluted with 5 mL of MeCN. The resulting mixture was
ﬁltered through a pad of Celite, which was rinsed with MeCN
(∼10 mL), and the solution was concentrated. The resulting residue
was diluted with H2O (20 mL) and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL),
and the combined organic portions were washed with H2O (2 × 10 mL)
and brine (10 mL). The organic layer was dried (NaSO4), after which
it was ﬁltered and concentrated. The product was isolated by column
chromatography, eluting with a gradient of EtOAc in hexanes (10 to
60% EtOAc).
