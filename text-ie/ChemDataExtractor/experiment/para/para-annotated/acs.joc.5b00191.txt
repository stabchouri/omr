ABSTRACT: A copper-catalyzed radical methylation/sp3 C−
H amination/oxidation reaction for the facile synthesis of
quinazolinone was developed. In this cascade reaction, dicumyl
peroxide acts not only as a useful oxidant but also as an
eﬃcient methyl source. Notably, a methyl radical, generated
from peroxide, was conﬁrmed by electron paramagnetic
resonance for the ﬁrst time.

T he use of peroxides as methylation reagents has gained

increasing attention in recent years. In 2008, Li developed
a novel method for the direct methylation of aryl C−H bonds.
In this reaction, dicumyl peroxide (DCP) was ﬁrst used as both
methylating reagents and hydrogen acceptor (Scheme 1a).1a

Scheme 1. Radical Methylation Reaction

Recently, a copper-catalyzed N-methylation of amides and O-
methylation of carboxylic acids was developed with DCP as the
methylating reagent by Chen’s group (Scheme 1b).1b In the
same year, Mao reported the copper-catalyzed methyl
esteriﬁcation of benzylic alcohols, aldehydes, and acids using
tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the methylating reagent
(Scheme 1b).1c Very recently, Cheng and Li, respectively,
reported the iron-catalyzed radical arylmethylation of activated
alkenes using di-tert-butylperoxide (DTBP) or DCP as the
methyl source,
leading to the biologically active product 3-
ethyl-3-substituted indolin-2-one (Scheme 1c).1d,e In light of
these results above, we reasoned that peroxides could be used
as a methyl source for
the construction of other useful
compounds.

On the other hand,

transition-metal-catalyzed oxidative
amination of the sp3 C−H bond has emerged as a powerful
and versatile method to form C−N bonds for its straightfor-
ward and atom-economical advantages, avoiding tedious
prefunctionalized processes.2 In particular, copper as an
inexpensive and less toxic metal catalyst has been widely used
to catalyze the sp3 C−H amination reaction.3 Our group has
also been focused on developing sp3 C−H amination for the
synthesis of heterocycles.4 Notably, quinazolinone as an
important structural unit has been widely found in many
natural products and pharmaceuticals.5 Many great eﬀorts have
been made toward their construction starting from a variety of
substrates,6 among which 2-aminobenzamide is probably the
most typical one. Herein, we demonstrated a facile method for
the synthesis of N-substituted quinazolinones starting from
anthranilamides using DCP as the methyl source (Scheme 1d).
This reaction involved a tandem N-methylation/sp3 C−H
amination/oxidation process in the presence of a copper
catalyst.
<para sub=“opt”>
Initially, we began our study with the reaction of 1 equiv of 2-
amino-N-phenylbenzanilide (1a) and 3 equiv of DCP as the
·H2O as the
oxidant in the presence of 20 mol % of Cu(OAc)2
catalyst. When the reaction mixture was stirred in 1 mL of PhCl
at 120 °C for 10 h under air, 3-phenyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone
(2a) was obtained in 20% yield (Table 1, entry 1). To improve
the reaction yield, 2 equiv of base was employed. To our
delight, imidazole gave the best result with 65% yield (Table 1,
entries 2−6). Besides, reducing the volume of solvent from 1 to
0.5 mL obviously increased the yield to 82% (Table 1, entry 7).
In the absence of copper salt, the corresponding product 2a was
obtained in 50% yield, while reducing the amount of
·H2O to 10 mol % also decreased the yield, which
Cu(OAc)2
showed that copper catalysts played an important role in this

catalysts such as CuCl and Cu(OTf)2 gave lower yields (Table
1, entries 10 and 11). Subsequently, various oxidants such as
TBHP, benzoyl tert-butyl peroxide (TBPB), and DTBP were
also examined but failed to give better results (Table 1, entries
12−14). After a brief survey of reaction temperature, we found
that the optimal reaction temperature was 120 °C (Table 1,
entries 15 and 16). Considering the atom-economy synthesis,
we reduced the amount of DCP to 2.0 and 1.0 equiv, and lower
reaction yields were observed (Table 1, entries 18 and 19).
Thus, the optimal reaction conditions were determined as
described in entry 7.

To gain an insight into the reaction mechanism, the active

The methyl radical was further trapped by 5,5-dimethyl-1-
proline-N-oxide (DMPO) in the electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) experiments.7 In Figure 1, EPR spectra of
the signal a, that is, the DMPO−CH3 adduct radical, was
identiﬁed by the characteristic hyperﬁne constants for the
nitrogen and proton A14N = 15.6 G and A1H = 23.2 G,
respectively. Another signal b was assigned to oxidized DMPO
with an A14N = 14.9 G for the nitrogen, which was possibly
oxidized by DCP, although the precise mechanism was not
clear. This observation implied that the reaction presumably
involved a free methyl radical.

Moreover, the possible intermediates of this reaction were
also investigated. When 2-(methylamino)-N-phenylbenzamide

2a was obtained in 50 and 15% yield, respectively. These results
indicated that both 4 and 5 are intermediates, and compound 4
may be the major intermediate.

the nucleophilic attack of 1a to the methyl cation. The
intermediate 4 then generates radical A1 via a SET process in
the presence of Cu2+. Then intermediate B1 is formed by
from A1. B1 can be further
removing a hydrogen radical
subjected to intramolecular nucleophilic attack to give the
amination product C. Finally, the further oxidation of C gives
the quinazolinone 2a. Meanwhile, the product 2a is probably
generated from 5 via a minor pathway. In the entire pathway,
imidazole is used as base to accept hydrogen.

In summary, we have developed a facile method for the
synthesis of quinazolinones from anthranilamides. The reaction
undergoes a copper-catalyzed tandem radical methylation/sp3
C−H amination/oxidation pathway. It is noted that DCP was
not only an oxidant but also an eﬃcient methylation reagent.
Meanwhile, this reaction has wide substrate scope and good
functional group tolerance, which represents a new avenue for
practical multiple C−N bond formations. Further investigation
to synthesize other heterocycles by this method is currently in
progress.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Information. Unless otherwise indicated, all commercial
reagents and solvents were used without additional puriﬁcation. 1H
NMR and 13C NMR used TMS as an internal reference (1H NMR 400
MHz, 13C NMR 100 MHz).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Quinazolinones. 2-
Amino-N-phenylbenzanilide 1a (0.2 mmol, 42.4 mg), DCP (0.6 mmol,
·H2O (0.04 mmol, 8 mg), and imidazole (0.4
162 mg), Cu(OAc)2
mmol, 27.2 mg) in PhCl (0.5 mL) were heated at 120 °C for 10 h in
air. The completion of the reaction was monitored by thin layer
chromatography and puriﬁed by column chromatography over silica
gel to give the pure product 2a as an orange solid (36 mg, 82% yield).
Preparation of Substrates. Synthesis of 1a, 1aa−fa, and 1ha−
oa. Isatoic anhydride (815 mg, 5 mmol) was dissolved in EtOH (10
mL) with aniline (916 μL, 5 mmol) and I2 (127 mg, 0.5 mmol). The
mixture was stirred under reﬂux in air overnight. Then the reaction
mixture was concentrated in vacuo, washed with EtOAc and Na2S2O3
saturated solution three times, and the organic layer washed with brine
and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The organic phase was
concentrated in vacuum and puriﬁed by chromatographic column on
silica gel, giving 2-amino-N-phenylbenzamide (1a) as a light yellow
solid (715 mg, yield 67%).8

organic phase was concentrated in vacuum and puriﬁed by a
chromatographic column on silica gel, giving 2-amino-5-methyl-N-
phenylbenzamide (1ab) as a light yellow solid (780 mg, yield 69%).8

1ac−ag were synthesized according to the procedure for 1ab.
Further Investigation of the Mechanism. Experimental Details
for the Capture of a Radical. A 10 mL reaction tube was equipped
with a magnetic stirrer, then 2-amino-N-phenylbenzamide (1a) (0.2
·H2O (0.04
mmol, 42.4 mg), DCP (0.6 mmol, 162 mg), Cu(OAc)2
mmol, 8 mg), and imidazole (0.4 mmol, 27.2 mg) in mesitylene (0.5
mL) were heated at 120 °C for 1 h in air. A 50 μL solution was taken
out into a small tube and mixed well with 0.3 mL of DMPO aqueous
solution. This mixture was quick-freezed with liquid nitrogen and
analyzed by EPR. The EPR measurements were performed at room
temperature.

Intermediate radical 1 trapped by DMPO was characterized by the
hyperﬁne coupling. The hyperﬁne constants for the nitrogen and
proton in a were A14N = 15.6 G and A1H = 23.2 G, respectively, and
DMPO can be readily oxidized by DCP. The oxidized DMPO had an

Synthesis of 1ga and 1pa. o-Nitrobenzoic acid (835 mg, 5 mmol)
was dissolved in dry DCM (5 mL) under N2. After being cooled to 0
°C, thionyl chloride (726 μL, 10 mmol) with DCM (5 mL) solution
was added slowly. The mixture was then allowed to warm to 40 °C for
3−6 h. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo
to leave the crude product as a light yellow oil.4e

o-Nitrobenzoyl chloride (5 mmol) in CHCl3 was treated with 2-
triﬂuoromethyl phenylamine (628 μL, 5 mmol) under N2 atmosphere
at reﬂux for 3 h. Upon being cooled, the reaction mixture was diluted
with CHCl3 and washed consecutively with aq 1 M HCl and saturated
NaHCO3 solution. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The mixture was
used for next step without further puriﬁcation.9

Eight drops of concentrated HCl were added to the solution of N-
(2-triﬂuoromethylphenyl)-2-nitrobenzamide (5 mmol) in EtOH (16
mL) and water (4 mL) with iron powder (1.12 g, 20 mmol). The
reaction was reﬂuxed at 80 °C for 2 h, ﬁltrated through silica gel, and
the ﬁltrate was concentrated under reduced pressure and then washed
with EtOAc and saturated NaHCO3 solution and brine. The organic
layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated in vacuum
under reduced pressure, and puriﬁed by chromatographic column on
silica gel, giving N-(2-triﬂuoromethylphenyl)-2-aminobenzamide
(1ga) as a light yellow solid (642 mg, the total yield of three steps
was 46%).4e

1pa was synthesized according to the procedure for 1ga.
Synthesis of 1qa−1ta. Isatoic anhydride (815 mg, 5 mmol) in
DMF was treated with benzylamine (547 μL, 5 mmol) at 50−60 °C
for 1 h. After the completion, the mixture was washed with EtOAc and
H2O. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4,
concentrated in vacuum under reduced pressure, and puriﬁed by
chromatographic column on silica gel, giving 2-amino-N-
(phenylmethyl)benzamide (1qa) as a white solid (1100 mg, yield
98%).10

Synthesis of 1ab−1ag. CrO3 (833 mg, 8.33 mmol) was added
portionwise to a hot (90 °C) suspension of the 5-methylisatin (806
mg, 5 mmol) in glacial AcOH (4 mL) and Ac2O (4 mL). The mixture
was heated at 90 °C for 2 h. After being cooled at room temperature,
the suspension was diluted with water (50 mL) and the solid collected
and abundantly washed with H2O. The obtained mixture was used for
next step without further puriﬁcation (796 mg, yield 90%).11

The mixture was dissolved in EtOH (10 mL) with aniline (916 μL,
5 mmol) and I2 (127 mg, 0.5 mmol). The mixture was stirred under
reﬂux in air overnight. Then the reaction mixture was concentrated in
vacuo, washed with EtOAc and saturated Na2S2O3 solution three
