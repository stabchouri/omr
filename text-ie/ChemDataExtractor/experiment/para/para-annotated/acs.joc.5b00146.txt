ABSTRACT: An eﬃcient, metal-free protocol used to
synthesize aryl benzo[b]furan thioethers based on the I2-
catalyzed cross-coupling of benzo[b]furans as well as the
electrophilic cyclization of 2-alkynylphenol derivatives with
aryl sulfonyl hydrazides was developed. Various 2-aryl and 3-
aryl benzo[b]furan thioethers were obtained in moderate to
good yields.

B enzofurans constitute basic units that frequently occur in

natural products and represent the most important type of
heterocycles in drug discovery,1 as they have been reported to
exhibit anticancer,2 antiviral,3 antifungal,4 anti-inﬂammatory5
and immunosuppressive activities.6 Therefore, signiﬁcant eﬀorts
have been put
forth toward the eﬃcient construction of
benzofuran scaﬀolds. To the best of our knowledge, only a few
methods have been reported to prepare 2-sulfenyl or 3-sulfenyl
benzo[b]furans including (i) electrophilic cyclization of 2-
(phenylethynyl)anisole with 4-nitrophenyl hypochlorothioite
(Scheme 1, eq 1),7 (ii) electrophilic cyclization of 2-sulfenyl-
alkynylanisoles with electrophile sources such as I2, ICl, Br2 and
PhSeBr (Scheme 1, eq 2),8 (iii) PdCl2-catalyzed annulation of
2-alkynylphenol derivatives with disulﬁdes in the presence of 2
equiv of I2 (Scheme 1, eq 3),9 (iv) FeCl3-promoted annulation
of 2-alkynylanisoles with disulﬁdes (Scheme 1, eq 4),10 and (v)
I2-mediated cyclization of 2-alkynylanisoles with diaryl
disulﬁdes (Scheme 1, eq 5).11 However, these methods require
either expensive and air-sensitive metal catalysts or
foul-
smelling, toxic and unstable sulfur sources such as sulfenyl
halides and disulﬁdes. Hence, a direct and concise method to
synthesize 2-sulfenyl or 3-sulfenyl benzo[b]furans using stable
and environmentally friendly reagents remains a signiﬁcant
challenge for organic chemists.

In the past two years, sulfonyl hydrazides, which are readily
accessible, nonodorous, and stable solids, have emerged as
novel sulfenylation reagents. Speciﬁcally, they have been used
in the sulfenylation of iodoles,12 alkanes,13 ethers,13 naphthols
and naphthylamines,14 as well as in the oxysulfenylation of
alkenes,15 hydrothiolation of alkynes,16 and in the synthesis of
unsymmetrical sulﬁdes.17 Recently, we reported the I2-catalyzed

sulfenylation of pyrazolones with aryl sulfonyl hydrazides
promoted by p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA).18 Inspired by the
aforementioned background and our interest in the chemistry
of sulfonyl hydrazides, we envisaged that sulfenyl benzo[b]-
furans could be produced via the direct sulfenylation of
benzofuran by sulfonyl hydrazides and electrophilic cyclization

of 2-alkynylphenol derivatives with sulfonyl hydrazides. Herein,
we disclose concise and convenient methods to synthesize 2-
aryl and 3-aryl benzo[b]furan thioethers using aryl sulfonyl
hydrazides as sulfenylation reagents via catalysis with iodine.
<para sub=“opt”>
To begin our investigation, benzofuran was reacted with 3-
chlorobenzenesulfonohydrazide 2a using Tian’s protocol (I2 10
mol %, ethanol, 70 °C). Unfortunately,
the sulfenylation
reaction did not occur at all, and benzofuran decomposed at
higher temperatures (120 °C). To circumvent this issue, a more
stable benzofuran derivative, 2-phenylbenzofuran 1a, was
reacted with 2a at 120 °C in ethanol (EtOH). To our delight,
the desired sulfenylation product 3aa was obtained in 75% yield
in the presence of 0.1 equiv of I2 as the catalyst at 120 °C
(Table 1, entry 1). To identify the optimal reaction conditions,

various solvents such as EtOH, 1,4-dioxane,
toluene, 1,2-
dichloroethane (DCE), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and
water were tested (Table 1, entry 2−6). 1,4-Dioxane gave the
best result, in that 83% yield was obtained. Next, a few reaction
temperatures and concentration were screened. Increasing the
reaction temperature to 130 °C led to a slightly diminished
yield (Table 1, entry 7). However, when the reaction was
carried out at 100 and 80 °C, the yield decreased to 71 and
58%, respectively (Table 1, entries 8 and 9). It was noteworthy
that decreasing the concentration led to a decrease of the yield
(Table 1, entry 10). Finally, the eﬀects of catalyst loading and
equivalents of 2a were investigated (Table 1, entry 11−14).
The results suggested that 0.1 equiv of the I2 catalyst was
required to obtain a suitable product yield. When the catalyst
loading was decreased to 1%, only a trace amount of the desired
product was obtained (Table 1, entry 12). For sulfonyl
hydrazide, 1.8 equiv of 2a were suﬃcient to produce a suitable
yield (Table 1, entry 13). Further decrease in the amount of 2a

led to a decrease in the yield (Table 1, entry 14). Notably,
unlike in the sulfenylation of naphthols, naphthylamines, and
pyrazolones, the addition of an acid did not facilitate the
transformation.14,18 In contrast, the presence of PTSA could
accelerate the decomposition of 2-phenylbenzofuran (1a)
which led to a diminished yield (Table 1, entry 15). Therefore,
the optimized reaction conditions were determined to be as
follows: 1a (1.0 mmol), 2a (1.8 mmol), I2 (0.1 mmol), and 1,4-
dioxane (0.5 mL), at 120 °C.

For aromatic sulfonyl hydrazides, both electron-withdrawing
and electron-donating groups, as well as meta-, ortho-, and para-
substitutions (2a−2f) were tolerated under the optimized
conditions. Notably, the identity of the substituent on the
benzofuran had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the sulfenylation reaction.
In regard to substituents in the 2-position, alkyl-substituted
benzofuran (1d) resulted in lower yields compared with the
corresponding phenyl substrate (1a) when using 4-methyl-
benzenesulfonohydrazide (2b) or 4-methoxybenzenesulfonohy-
drazide (2d) as the sulfenylation reagent. Moreover, electron-
withdrawing groups in the 2-position of the aryl substituent
(1c) and 5-position of benzofuran (1f and 1i) resulted in lower
yields as compared to that with substrates containing electron-
donating groups.

General Experimental Methods. All solvents were distilled prior
to use. Aryl benzo[b]furans were prepared according to the literature
procedure.19 2-Alkynylphenol derivatives were prepared according to
the literature procedure.20 Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were
used as received without further puriﬁcation. For chromatography,
200−300 mesh silica gel was employed. 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra
were recorded at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts are
reported in ppm using tetramethylsilane as internal standard. IR
spectra were recorded in wave numbers (cm−1) with a FT-IR
spectrometer. HRMS was performed on an FTMS mass instrument.
Melting points are reported as uncorrected.
I2-Catalyzed Reactions between Aryl
Benzo[b]furans 1a−i, 4a−c and Aryl Sulfonyl Hydrazides 2a−f
(Table 2 and Table 3). Aryl benzo[b]furan (1.0 mmol), aryl sulfonyl
hydrazide (1.8 mmol), I2 (25.4 mg, 0.1 mmol) and 1,4-dioxane (0.5
mL) were mixed in a sealed tube. The mixture was stirred at 120 °C
until the aryl benzo[b]furan disappeared detected by TLC. Then, the
solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was
puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatography to aﬀord the pure
product.
