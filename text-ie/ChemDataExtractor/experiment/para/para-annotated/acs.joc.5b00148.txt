ABSTRACT: A novel protocol for the synthesis of tetrasub-
stituted oleﬁns through a biomimetic approach has been
explored. Both mono- and diarylations were performed under
ambient oxygen pressure, giving a range of highly hindered
tetrasubstituted alkenes. For diarylation of disubstituted
substrates, it was demonstrated that the second arylation is
the rate-limiting step of the overall transformation.

■ INTRODUCTION

Tetrasubstituted oleﬁns constitute an important class of
compounds since many of
these oleﬁns show signiﬁcant
biological activities (Figure 1). For example, (Z)-Tamoxifen
displays eﬀects against breast cancer1 while Rofecoxib is a
powerful nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug.2 Dibenzoxapin
and related compounds have been evaluated as nuclear hormone
receptor modulators,3 and ﬁnally, tetrasubstituted isocombre-
tastatins A-4 have been recently identiﬁed as new tubulin
inhibitors.4

Reported eﬃcient methods for accessing such unsaturated
structures are mainly based on the use of transition-metal
catalysis via carbofunctionalization of alkynes,5 oleﬁn meta-
thesis,6 or cross-coupling reactions.7 Among the latter, the
oxidative Heck coupling has been frequently employed for the
preparation of disubstituted alkenes.8 However, only a few
examples of successful Heck arylation have been reported
regarding the synthesis of tri- or tetrasubstituted oleﬁns.7b−e
There are several problems associated with the oxidative Heck
coupling between aromatic heterocycles and trisubstituted
oleﬁns to give tetrasubstituted oleﬁns. The problems with the
latter reaction can be rationalized by the low reactivity of the
trisubstituted substrates. Due to steric hindrance around the
unsaturated core, the latter alkenes are not reactive enough to
undergo the required carbopalladation. Another problem is
associated with the regeneration of the active catalyst. In general,
the use of strong oxidants or additivessuch as TEMPO
(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl radical) derivatives7e and/
or inorganic salts7c,dis required, thus reducing the applicability
and sustainability of the reaction. In addition, in the dehydrogen-
ative version of the Heck reactionthe Fujiwara−Moritani
reaction9the challenging metal insertion into the aromatic C−
H bond makes the synthetic task even more diﬃcult. Therefore,
there is a demand for improvements of

few years, we have been involved in the
development of new sustainable C−C couplings via C−H
activations using a biomimetic approach.10 Following this
concept,
the high kinetic barrier preventing the catalyst
regeneration is circumvented by the use of catalytic amounts of
electron-transfer mediators (ETMs).11 In this way, the reduced
catalyst can be reoxidized by O2 at atmospheric pressure,
producing water as the sole byproduct of the reaction. On the
basis of this strategy, we have previously established protocols for
the dehydrogenative Heck reaction that have the following
advantages: (i) relative low palladium and arene loadings, (ii)
utilization of O2 under ambient pressure as the oxidant, and (iii)
extension of the scope to nonbiased oleﬁns and heterocycles.
Our continued interest in this ﬁeld prompted us to explore the
preparation of tetrasubstituted oleﬁns via a biomimetic approach,
and our contribution is reported herein.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
We ﬁrst planned to prepare a trisubstituted oleﬁn via a
dehydrogenative Heck reaction that could be used as starting
material for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted oleﬁns. In our
previously reported arylation of nonbiased oleﬁns,10a we showed
that acridine as a ligand dramatically enhances the reaction rate
and totally controls the site selectivity in the coupling with
veratrole. We initiated our studies with a 1:10 ratio of alkene 1a
and veratrole (2a) using Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %) as catalyst,
acridine (5 mol %) as ligand, and benzoquinone (BQ) (10 mol
%) and iron phthalocyanine Fe(Pc) (2.5 mol %) as electron-
transfer mediators in a mixture of acetic acid:dioxane (1:1, v:v)

for 24 h at 90 °C under ambient oxygen pressure (Table 1, entry
1). Interestingly, we found that formation of the trisubstituted
alkene 3aa was accompanied by the tetrasubstituted alkene 4aa.
This reaction shows that the biomimetic approach is a viable
strategy for providing access to tetrasubstituted oleﬁns. Taking
into account that there are not many examples in the literature
for the diarylation of alkenes,10f,12 it was highly interesting to
develop a one-pot double arylation of 1a.

<para sub=“opt”>
Attempts to increase the rate of the reaction by the use of pure
acetic acid as the solvent were unsuccessful and led to only 17%
yield of 4aa (Table 1, entry 2). An increase of the reaction
temperature to 100 °C under the standard conditions resulted in
an improvement and gave oleﬁn 4aa in a 35% yield, (Table 1,
entry 3). However, a further increase of the reaction temperature
to 110 °C decreased the amount of 4aa to 3% (entry 4). The
dramatic decrease of 4aa may be due to decomposition at 110 °C
under the acidic conditions. An increase of the catalytic amount
of ETMs did not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the yield of the coupling, and
modiﬁcations of the solvent ratio led to decreased yields (entries
5−7). We were pleased to ﬁnd that the use of a higher catalyst
loading (entry 8) or an increase of the arene loading (entry 9)

improved the yield of 4aa up to 66%. Considering the
importance of the choice of solvent in the Fujiwara−Moritani
reaction, we also evaluated the role of a range of cosolvents such
as acetonitrile instead of dioxane,13 or pivalic acid or propionic
acid instead of acetic acid, but none of these changes increased
the yield of 4aa (entries 10−12). We chose to conclude our
optimization studies with an additional screening of ETMs, but
these alternative catalytic systems were not more eﬃcient than
those used in the standard conditions (entries 13−14).

The double dehydrogenative sequence for the conversion of
disubstituted alkene 1a into trisubstituted alkene 3aa and
tetrasubstituted alkene 4aa was monitored by 1H NMR
spectroscopy (Figure 2). The reaction proﬁle indicates that
oleﬁn 1a is almost totally consumed after only 2 h, mostly giving
3aa with only trace amounts of 4aa. Then, the concentration of
3aa is decreasing slowly with concomitant formation of 4aa,
demonstrating that the rate-limitating step of the sequence is the
formation of the desired tetrasubstituted product. The steric
hindrance around the double bond certainly slows down the
carbopalladation.

reactive sites, generating complicated mixtures of isomers after a
double cross-coupling. Usually, the site selectivity is controlled
by (i) electronic factors with a preference for the most electron-
rich carbon, (ii) steric factors with a preference for the less-
hindered carbon. First, the inﬂuence of the substituents in 1,1-
disubstituted alkene substrates was examined by reaction with
veratrole 2a as the aromatic coupling partner. We were pleased to
ﬁnd that a range of esters smoothly underwent the diarylation,
giving 4aa−4ca in good yields. An acetate and a ketone are both
tolerated in the double dehydrogenative cross-coupling, albeit in
lower yields (4da and 4ea). An oleﬁn substrate containing an
isatin moiety underwent a smooth reaction, resulting in the
formation of 4fa in 55% yield. To our satisfaction, the site
selectivity of the reaction with 1,2-diethoxybenzene and o-xylene
was complete, leading to two highly substituted scaﬀolds 4ab and
4ac. However, no diarylated product was observed when 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene 2d was employed as coupling partner, the
reaction yielding only the trisubstituted oleﬁn 3ad in an 83%
yield. The second arylation is apparently suppressed due to steric
reasons. The lack of reactivity due to steric eﬀects was conﬁrmed
by using 1,3-dimethoxybenzene 2e as coupling partner. Indeed, a
63:37 mixture in favor of the ortho-isomer 3ae-α (the most
reactive site) was isolated, accompanied by roughly 5% of a
diarylated scaﬀold. In this example, due to its steric hindrance,

which is unfortunately the less reactive carbon of the arene.

We also conﬁrmed the inﬂuence of steric hindrance starting
from trisubstituted alkenes 1g and 1h (Scheme 2). Reaction of 1g
with arene 2d did not deliver the desired product 5gd, the
starting materials being mostly recovered and no identiﬁable
byproduct being detected. Furthermore, with arene 2e, only one
isomer 5ge was obtained in a 16% yield, whereas 57% of oleﬁn 1g
remained intact. These systematic studies on these sterically
hindered substrates led to some instructive results: ortho-C−H
functionalization of simple arenes is very slow with trisubstituted
oleﬁns, illustrating the inﬂuence of steric eﬀects on the rate. The
reaction was also conducted with 1,3-benzodioxole (1f) as
coupling partner, and surprisingly, the selectivity of the coupling
was not complete. The desired alkenes 5gf were isolated as a
mixture of isomers in a 18:82 ratio in favor of the β-alkenylated
scaﬀold. In light of these results, it was of interest to establish the
selectivity of anisole as coupling partner. Anisole is known to
mainly undergo palladium insertion at (i) para, (ii) ortho, (iii)
meta positions.10a−c,13As expected, no coupling occurred at the
ortho position of anisole, and 5gg was isolated as a mixture of
isomers in a 0:46:54 (o:m:p) ratio. Similarly, toluene and
chlorobenzene were also successfully employed and only two
regioisomers were detected in each case (5gh and 5gi). To

further explore the scope of this transformation, the coupling
reaction with 1g (or 1h) was conducted with difunctionalized
arenes such as veratrole, naphtalene, or o-xylene, which furnished
a range of densely substituted alkenes 5ga, 5gj, 5gc, and 5ha with
synthetically useful yields and complete selectivity.15

■ CONCLUSION

In summary, we have developed an operationally simple protocol
for the synthesis of tetrasubstituted oleﬁns via mono or double
aerobic dehydrogenative Heck couplings through a biomimetic
approach. It was shown that the steric hindrance around the
unsaturated core plays a key role in the selectivity of the reaction,
and a range of highly substituted alkenes were isolated with
complete chemoselectivity around the double bond and with
partial to complete regioselectivity depending on the arene.
Remarkably, the reaction involves readily available nonfunction-
alized reagents and proceeds at ambient oxygen pressure.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Functionalized
Oleﬁns 3, 4, or 5. Pd(OAc)2 (5 mol %), acridine (5 mol %), p-
benzoquinone (10 mol %), iron phtalocyanine (2.5 mol %), oleﬁn 1 (1
equiv), arene 2 (15 equiv), and AcOH:dioxane (1:1, 1.0 mL) were
charged in a Schlenk tube. The resulting mixture was degassed three
times under reduced pressure before introducing oxygen gas with a
balloon. After vigorous stirring at 100 °C for 24 h, the reaction mixture
was cooled to room temperature, diluted with AcOEt, ﬁltered through
Celite, rinsed with AcOEt, and concentrated under vacuum. Products
were puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography with hexane/ethyl acetate to
yield the desired functionalized oleﬁns 3, 4, or 5.
