ABSTRACT: Hybrid [n]arenes, the class of medium-sized
macrocyclic compounds consisting of diﬀerent alkoxybenzene
units, were obtained by a simple, one-pot, direct condensation
of two diﬀerent alkoxybenzenes with formaldehyde catalyzed
by a Brønsted acid (triﬂuoroacetic acid). We have shown that,
under Brønsted acid catalysis, this reaction is reversible and
therefore governed by the relative stability of the products.
The main macrocyclic products are hybrid [n]arenes
consisting of four alkoxybenzene units of [2 + 2] or [3 + 1]
stoichiometry. However, an unusual [3 + 2] hybrid macrocycle
was also obtained as a main product of the condensation
between 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene, and
formaldehyde. The stability of the hybrid products and the reversibility of the reaction were further conﬁrmed by a scrambling
experiment,
involving pillar[5]arene and per-O-methylated resorcin[4]arene. The scrambling experiment has given hybrid
macrocycles in yields comparable with those obtained in condensation reactions. NMR spectra and X-ray structures of hybrid
[n]arenes indicate that 1,2- and 1,3-dialkoxybenzene units are ﬂexible parts of macrocyclic rings. However,
the 1,4-
dialkoxybenzene units present considerable steric hindrance, resulting in the formation of
isomers and inherently chiral
macrocycles due to inhibited rotation. The recognition properties toward various organic cations were also determined. Highly
selective recognition of the N-methylpyridinium cation was observed for the [3 + 2] hybrid macrocycle.

■ INTRODUCTION
The discovery1−4 and realization of the potential5,6 of cyclic
phenolic oligomeric compounds called calix[n]arenes was
undoubtedly one of
supramolecular
chemistry. On the basis of their skeleton, many supramolecular
functional architectures have been constructed.7−10 As it
seemed the pool of basic macrocyclic skeletons was complete,
surprisingly,
in 2008, a new, very simple macrocylic
polyphenolic building block was discovered. Ogoshi et al.
presented the pillar[5]arene, a simple macrocylic product of the
reaction between 1,4-dimethoxybenzene and formaldehyde.11
More recently, Schneebeli et al. obtained the family of
asar[n]arenes,12 and Chen et al. obtained biphen[n]arenes.13
During a very short period of time, many groups reported
numerous applications of these new macrocycles including
sensing,14−17 construction of rotaxanes,18−20 supramolecular
polymers,21−24 switches,25−27 or artiﬁcial channels.28 Such a
great
indicates that new semirigid supramolecular
scaﬀolds having cavities that may serve as binding pockets are
still sought after.

interest

Cyclic oligomers of phenols are commonly obtained by
condensation between alkoxybenzenes or hydroxybenzenes
with aldehydes. Calix[n]arenes and resorcin[4]arenes, featuring
free OH groups, are readily prepared from the corresponding
phenolic monomers by a condensation of
the respective
hydroxybenzenes with a large range of aldehydes using

Brønsted acid or Brønsted base catalysis. Other macrocycles,
for example, cyclotricatechylenes or pillar[5]arenes, cannot be
obtained directly from phenolic precursors. Instead, they have
to be obtained through their O-alkylated derivatives by Lewis
acid catalyzed condensation of alkoxybenzenes with aldehydes
31,32). Brønsted acids
(e.g., BF3
can also be successfully used as catalysts for the formation of
cyclic products from alkoxybenzenes and aldehydes as shown
by the work of Moravcová and co-workers,33 Moore et al.,34 as
well as Weinelt and Schneider.35 A strategy utilizing benzyl
alcohols as surrogates of aldehyde functions has also been
reported for synthesis of O-alkylated derivatives, for example,
octamethoxyresorcin[4]arenes36 or phlouroglucinols,37 using
triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA) as a catalyst. Recently, we have also
found out that pillar[5]arenes can be synthesized by a Brønsted
acid mediated direct reaction of alkoxybenzene and form-
aldehyde.38 The important ﬁnding was that the reaction is
reversible under Brønsted acid catalysis (TFA in that case).
Therefore, thermodynamic stability of the products is of crucial
importance for the reaction outcome. In the case of deca-O-
alkylpillar[5]arenes, solvent molecules (dichloromethane or
1,2-dichloroethane but not CHCl3) eﬀectively template the
synthesis of pillar[5]arenes by a combination of hydrogen···π

and halogen···π bonds. Other reports have also suggested that,
under highly acidic conditions, the reaction of alkoxybenzenes
with aldehydes is thermodynamically controlled.39 For example,
Urbaniak and Iwanek have shown that octa-O-alkylresorcin-
[4]arenes can be postsynthetically isomerized in the presence
of TFA.40 It should be noted that these observations have only
been applied to the synthesis of known macrocycles (also
available by other condensation methods) and have not been
used thus far for obtaining new macrocyclic scaﬀolds. In the
current paper, we show that thermodynamically controlled
reactions of various alkoxybenzenes with formaldehyde can be
used for eﬀective formation of new hybrid macrocycles.

two diﬀerent
polyalkoxybenzenes were mixed in 0.1 M/0.1 M ratio with an

for macrocyclization reactions. For comparison, asar[n]arenes12

obtained in yields up to 22%.
In the case of 1,3-
dimethoxybenzene and 1,4-dihexoxybenzene, a mixture of two

macrocycle 9, consisting of three 1,3-dimethoxybenzene units
and one 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, was obtained in 47% yield, and
macrocycle 7 containing three 1,3-dimethoxybenzene units and
one 1,4-dihexoxybenzene unit was obtained in 26% yield.
Interestingly, an unusual [3 + 2] stoichiometry was observed
for the condensation of 1,3,5-trialkoxybenzene 4 and 1,4-
dimethoxybenzene 3a yielding macrocycle 13 as a main
product (35% yield). It should also be noted that nonhybrid
macrocyclic products, containing only one type of alkoxyben-
zene unit, like knowns 10, 11, and 12, are also obtained in high
yields (85%) using this procedure.

important to note that addition of a portion of formaldehyde is

indicates that the presence of a suitable amount of “free”

be supposed that, under the current conditions, equilibration is
reasonably fast only at the early stages of the macrocyclization
reaction. However, after the free formaldehyde is used up,
equilibration may be too slow to be eﬀective.

<para sub="scope">
The wide range of substrates successfully converted into
macrocycles shows that the current conditions are applicable
for obtaining various O-alkylated hybrid [n]arenes in a direct
way. We have also tested if the current procedure can be
applied for
featuring free OH groups. Such
macrocycles are highly desirable, since they can be readily
functionalized. The reactions of 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,4-dihydrox-
ybenzene or phlorogluocinol with formaldehyde under our
standard conditions (CHCl3, TFA) or under
literature
conditions (MeOH/H2O/HCl) failed to give macrocyclic
products. These results show that hybrid macrocycles featuring
free OH groups cannot be synthesized directly but only via the
respective alkoxy derivatives.

<para sub=“props”>
Conformational Features. The hybrid approach can be a
powerful method for obtaining macrocycles with modulated
shapes.41−46 In the current case, the macrocyclic rings obtained
by the hybrid approach have medium sizes (14÷23-membered
rings). Such rings exhibit various degrees of ﬂexibility resulting
in diverse conformational and even conﬁgurational features. A
spectacular manifestation of inhibited ring rotation is observed
in the case of macrocyles 5 and 6 that were synthesized in the
reaction between 2, 3a, and formaldehyde. The isomers were
chromatographically separated (1:2 ratio) and analyzed by
NMR and X-ray crystallography. Isomers 5 and 6 proved to
have the same number of signals in the NMR spectra in

agreement with either D2 or C2h symmetry. Considering the
size of the macrocyclic ring (18-membered) and its relative
rigidity, we assumed that the observed isomerism comes from
inhibited rotation of 1,4-dialkoxy units through the macrocyclic
ring (Figure 4a).
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Our hypothesis was conﬁrmed through analysis of splitting in
1H NMR spectra and X-ray crystallography. Two separate
signals were observed for hydrogen atoms of methylene bridges
with characteristic geminal coupling constants (Figures S1 and
S4, Supporting Information). X-ray analyses indicate that, for
both 5 and 6, 1,3-dialkoxy units (green, Figure 4b, c) are
coplanar and parallel to the main macrocyclic plane (deﬁned by
four methylene bridges), while 1,4-dialkoxy units (blue, Figure
4b, c) are perpendicular to the main macrocyclic planes. Van
der Waals representation of molecules of 5 and 6 shows that
there is almost no room inside the macrocyclic rings of 5 and 6
(Figure 4b). Even assuming that 1,3-dialkoxy units can rotate
out of the plane of the macroring, the short distance between
1,4-dialkoxy units (5.0 Å) ﬁxes their relative positions. The
stability of the isomers has been experimentally conﬁrmed by
their successful chromatographic separation and the fact that
they do not interconvert in CDCl3 solution even after a few
weeks. It is also interesting to note that 5, which has D2
symmetry,
inherently chiral (although currently only
obtained as a mixture of enantiomers).
</para>

<para sub=“props”>
For 7, the presence of only a single 1,4-dialkoxybenzene unit
(Figure 5) results in a partially averaged geometry (as seen in
the NMR spectra, Figure S6, Supporting Information).
Hydrogen atoms of the methylene bridges positioned next to
1,4-dihexoxybenzene are diﬀerentiated and exhibit a geminal
coupling (J = 15.9 Hz). On the other hand, signals of
methylene hydrogen atoms that are positioned between 1,3-
dimethoxybenzene units appear as a singlet in the 1H NMR
spectrum. The X-ray structure of 7 shows a distorted “boat”
conformation of
the macrocyclic ring (Figure 5b). The
molecule of 7, even in the idealized boat conformation,
is
devoid of symmetry elements, rendering all methylene protons
diastereotopic. Thus, averaging of some signals of methylene
protons can be explained by fast ﬂipping of 1,3-dimethox-
ybenzene units. However, the splitting of the signals of the two
other methylene groups units at room temperature indicates a
lack of rotation and suggests chirality of 7.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
For the compounds that do not contain 1,4-dialkoxybenzene
units, for example, 8 and 9 (Figure 3), the ﬂexibility of the
macrocyclic rings is much higher. In the case of 8 and 9, their
1H and 13C NMR spectra contain a reduced number of signals,
and the methylene bridges appear as singlets (for 9) or as a
broad singlet (for 8) (Figures S11−S13, S15, and S16,

However, the 1,4-dialkoxy unit presents considerable steric
hindrance. For some macrocyclic rings, rotation of this unit is
not possible. Therefore, formation of various isomers can be
observed, and symmetry features of this unit may even generate

Supporting Information). The X-ray structures indicate that
both macrocyclic rings exhibit boat conformations in the solid
state (Figure 6). Analysis of the ring distances suggests that a
full rotation of any of the aromatic rings through the macroring
is not possible. However, partial ﬂipping of all aromatic rings is
probable, resulting in averaging of the NMR signals. Similar
dynamic behavior was also observed for [3 + 2] macrocycle 13
being the largest macrocycle obtained. In this case, all signals
for protons of the methylene bridges are singlets (Figure S18,

■ CONCLUSIONS

It
is commonly perceived that even simple macrocyclic
products can present a considerable synthetic challenge due
to the numerous complications in their synthesis and often low
cyclization yields. Therefore, the number of easy-to-prepare
macrocyclic scaﬀolds is quite limited. On the other hand, there
is a continuing need for new semirigid macrocyclic compounds
for the construction of new supramolecular systems. In this
paper, we have shown that construction of new cyclic phenolic
oligomers can be eﬀectively achieved by a hybrid approach. It

would seem that such an approach has much less chance of
success than the synthesis macrocycles consisting of identical
units. However, we have proven that, by using thermodynami-
cally driven acid-catalyzed condensations,
it can be very
eﬀective. The obtained products extend the pool of relatively
easy available macrocycles for various applications in supra-
molecular chemistry. We predict that the rich chemistry of the
phenolic group,
including O-substitution, allows for easy
functionalization of the currently obtained skeletons for their
further modiﬁcations. Presence of two diﬀerent types of units in
one macrocycle allows for potential applications as “biased”
supramolecular structures,48,49 and diﬀerentiation of reactivity
enables
selective introduction of orthogonal or multiple
functions.

General Procedures. Procedure A. To a solution of polyalkox-
ybenzene A (10 mmol) in CHCl3 (50 mL), paraformaldehyde (10
mmol) and TFA (5 mL) were added. The reaction was reﬂuxed for 2
h. During the reaction, the color of the mixture changed from colorless
to dark purple, dark blue, or dark green (depending on a speciﬁc
substrate). The reaction was cooled down to room temperature (rt),
and excess of Na2CO3 was added to neutralize the TFA. The mixture
was ﬁltered oﬀ and evaporated to dryness. The products were isolated
by chromatography (30 g of silica gel, CHCl3/ethyl acetate or hexane).
Procedure B. To a solution of polyalkoxybenzene A (5 mmol) and
B (5 mmol) in CHCl3 (50 mL), paraformaldehyde (10 mmol) and
TFA (5 or 20 mL) were added. The reaction was reﬂuxed (2 h to 4
days), and the progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC). During the reaction, the color of the mixture changed from
colorless to dark purple, dark blue, or dark green (depending on a
speciﬁc set of substrates and conditions). The reaction was cooled
down to rt, and an excess of Na2CO3 was added to neutralize the TFA.
The mixture was ﬁltered oﬀ and evaporated to dryness. The products
were isolated by chromatography (50−200 g of silica gel, CHCl3/ethyl
acetate or hexane). After chromatography, some products were
recrystallized from acetone or MeCN.

Procedure C. To a solution of polyalkoxybenzene A (7.5 mmol)
and B (2.5 mmol) in CHCl3 (50 mL), paraformaldehyde (10 mmol)
and TFA (2.5 or 10 mL) were added. The reaction was reﬂuxed (2 h
to 4 days), and the progress was monitored by TLC. During the
reaction, the color changed from colorless to dark purple, dark blue, or
dark green (depending on speciﬁc substrates). The reaction was
cooled down to rt, and an excess of Na2CO3 was added to neutralize
the TFA. The mixture was ﬁltered oﬀ and evaporated to dryness. The
products were isolated by chromatography (silica gel, CHCl3/ethyl
acetate or hexane). After chromatography, some products were
recrystallized from acetone or MeCN.

Scrambling Procedure. To a solution of per-hexoxypillar[5]arene
15, (0.584 g, 0.4 mmol) and per-methoxylresorcin[4]arene 11 (0.300
g, 0.5 mmol) in CHCl3 (50 mL) and TFA (10 mL), paraformaldehyde
(20 mg) was added. The reaction was reﬂuxed for 1 day, and the
progress was monitored by TLC and NMR. During the reaction, the
color changed from colorless to dark purple. After 1 day, the reaction
was cooled down to rt, and an excess of Na2CO3 was added to
neutralize the TFA. The mixture was ﬁltered oﬀ and evaporated to
dryness. The products (5 and 6) were isolated by chromatography as a
mixture of diastereoisomers (silica gel, ﬁrst hexane/CHCl3 1:1, next

added. The reaction was reﬂuxed for 3 days, and the progress was
monitored by TLC (CHCl3/ethyl acetate 100:5). During the reaction,
the color changed from colorless to dark purple. The reaction was
cooled down to rt, and an excess of Na2CO3 was added to neutralize
the TFA. The mixture was ﬁltered oﬀ and evaporated to dryness. The
products were isolated by chromatography (75 g of silica gel, eluent:
