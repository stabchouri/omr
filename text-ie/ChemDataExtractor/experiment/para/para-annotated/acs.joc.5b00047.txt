ABSTRACT: Intramolecular hydrogen abstraction reactions
among ketoprofen (KP) and purine nucleoside dyads have
been proposed to form ketyl-sugar biradical intermediates in
acetonitrile. Femtosecond transient absorption studies on KP
and purine nucleoside dyads reveal that the triplet state of the
KP moiety of the dyads with cisoid structure decay faster (due
to an intramolecular hydrogen abstraction reaction to produce
a ketyl-sugar biradical intermediate) than the triplet state of
the KP moiety of the dyads with transoid structure detected in
acetonitrile solvent. For the cisoid 5-KP-dG dyad, the triplet
state of the KP moiety decays too fast to be observed by ns-
TR3; only the ketyl-sugar biradical intermediates are detected
by ns-TR3 in acetonitrile. For the cisoid 5-KP-dA dyad, the
triplet states of the KP moiety could be observed at early
nanosecond delay times, and then it quickly undergoes
intramolecular hydrogen abstraction to produce a ketyl-sugar
biradical intermediate. For the cisoid 5-KPGly-dA and transoid
3-KP-dA dyads, the triplet state of the KP moiety had a longer lifetime due to the long distance chain between the KP moiety and
the purine nucleoside (5-KPGly-dA) and the transoid structure (3-KP-dA). The experimental and computational results suggest
that the ketyl-sugar biradical intermediate is generated with a higher eﬃciency for the cisoid dyad. However, the transoid dyad
exhibits similar photochemistry behavior as the KP molecule, and no ketyl-sugar biradical intermediate was observed in the ns-
TR3 experiments for the transoid 3-KP-dA dyad.

to diverse ﬁelds like medicinal chemistry, carcinogenesis,
toxicology, and biotechnology.7 Oxidative damage to DNA
may be induced by a number of agents, such as free radicals,
reactive oxygen species (ROS), UV light, or
ionizing
radiation.8−11 Researchers have found that the nucleobases
and the sugar moiety are the main units to be attacked.

successfully established the molecular basis for the investigation
of phototoxic and photoallergic properties caused by KP.

damage in vitro upon irradiation and then photosensitize the
formation of pyrimidine dimers and single strand breaks with
high quantum yields.34 The possible mechanism(s) may be
related to a substituted benzophenone, which is able to induce
both electron and energy transfer to DNA. Similar behaviors
have also been observed for DNA damage caused by other
NSAIDs.40 Chouini-Lalanne and co-workers have pointed out
that KP undergoes a decarboxylation process, generating radical
derivatives and the corresponding photoproducts which
damage DNA and stimulate lytic activity on cells when KP is
irradiated in aqueous buﬀer solution.22

In order to more fully understand the interaction between
DNA and KP, scientists have utilized a single nucleoside as a
model to investigate the reaction mechanism(s) between KP
and nucleosides.41 Photosensitization of DNA induced by KP
involves two major types of mechanisms: (1) triplet−triplet
energy transfer leading to thymine dimerization and (2) an

Nanosecond laser ﬂash photolysis has been used by Miranda
and co-workers to study the possible enantiodiﬀerentiation
during DNA nucleosides photosensitization by KP.42 A
signiﬁcant enantiodiﬀerentiation was observed in the quenching
of triplet KP by thymine and deoxyguaosine which can be
related to the Pateno−Buchi photoreaction and ketyl radical
formation. However, KP photosensitized purine nucleosides
have not been widely studied.43 A better understanding of the
photochemical reactivity of a KP photosensitizer toward the
DNA nucleobases is essential to anticipate the photobiological
risk associated with their use by patients.

At present,

the explicit

identiﬁcation of

the reaction
intermediates and elucidation of the reaction mechanisms of
KP and purine nucleoside dyads are still not clear since only a
few studies have been done to examine the chemical reactivity
relationships and environmental eﬀects on the photosensitiza-
tion processes. A deeper and more precise knowledge of the
active sites and reaction mechanisms can make an important
contribution to improve the understanding of
the photo-
sensitizing potential of new drug candidates. The rate of the
photochemical reaction induced by drugs is always very fast,
most of the intermediates generated from the reactions of
interest may only last for a very short while and likely on the
picosecond or nanosecond time scale.
the
complexity of the photochemical reaction process of KP and
related drug molecules also makes this type of study diﬃcult.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

KP-purine nucleoside dyads were synthesized according to
methods previously reported in the literature.43 Scheme 1
shows the side chain of KP connected with the deoxyguanosine
(dG), deoxyadenosine (dA) and glycine derivative (KPGly)
with deoxyadenosine (dA). 5-KP-dA and 3-KP-dA are a couple
of compounds with cisoid vs transoid spatial arrangement, 5-
KP-dG and 5-KPGly-dA have cisoid conﬁguration like 5-KP-
dA.

presents ns-TR3 spectra of 1 mM 5-KP-dA and 3-KP-dA
obtained in acetonitrile (MeCN). Although 5-KP-dA and 3-KP-
dA are isomers, the feature of the ns-TR3 spectra of 5-KP-dA
exhibit a noticeable diﬀerence from that of 3-KP-dA. For 5-KP-
dA, at an early nanosecond delay time (0 ns), the main
resonance Raman spectra have bands at 966, 1173, 1222, and
1540 cm−1 accompanied by a small band at 1583 cm−1. At later
delay times, the ﬁrst species quickly decays and the band at
1583 cm−1 dramatically increases in intensity. However, for 3-
KP-dA, the main Raman bands appear at 966, 1173, 1222, and
1540 cm−1 and remain visible within 250 ns, only a very weak
band at 1583 cm−1 is observed. In an attempt to identify the
intermediates observed here, the contribution of the second
intermediate was removed to obtain a subtracted resonance
Raman spectrum at early time (0 ns), which was then
compared with an authentic spectrum of the triplet state of
KP (3KP) observed in MeCN (this comparison is shown in
Figure 2).25 The excellent correlation between these two
spectra demonstrates that the ﬁrst transient species for 5-KP-dA
is the triplet state character species, which is associated with the

observed. This demonstrates that the intermolecular interaction
of KP and dA cannot eﬃciently achieve the electron transfer
and hydrogen abstraction due to the low collision probability
between the free 3KP and dA species, while the intramolecular
interaction of 5-KP-dA with a cisoid structure may achieve a
high eﬃciency for the intramolecular hydrogen abstraction.
Photolysis of KP-tethered purine nucleosides dyads evolves 2-
deoxyribonolactone through the generation of a ketyl-C1
biradical intermediate.43 Ns-TR3 spectra of 5-KP-dA demon-
strate that a ketyl-sugar biradical
intermediate is probably
produced even in the relatively inert solvent (MeCN), which
implies water may not be needed for producing the ketyl-sugar
intermediate.43 This reveals that hydrogen bonding
biradical
may not be necessary for
the intramolecular hydrogen
abstraction between the KP and purine nucleoside base in
the electronic excited state reaction.44

chromophore of KP of the 5-KP-dA dyad (represented as
5-3[KP]-dA here). This intermediate promptly produces the
second species even in the MeCN solvent. In contrast, the
triplet state of 3-KP-dA (3-3[KP]-dA) has a relatively long
lifetime, just like the 3KP species formed after photoexcitation
of KP in MeCN.
</para>
In the following sections, two questions are addressed: (1)
Why do these two isomers exhibit very diﬀerent photochemical
behavior? (2) What intermediate is generated at later times for
5-KP-dA? When KP is irradiated by the 266 nm pump laser in
MeCN, a weak band is observed that correlates with the decay
of 3KP. This weak intermediate could be generated by an
intramolecular hydrogen abstraction.25 As for 3-KP-dA, the
analogous feature is also observed. But for 5-KP-dA, the Raman
signal of the new species is so large that it overwhelms the
Raman intensity of 5-3[KP]-dA. Miranda and co-workers
reported that the intramolecular interaction between KP and
the purine base resulted in a remarkable quenching of the
excited KP-like triplet state.43 This could in principle be
associated with an electron transfer process. To explore the
reaction eﬃciency between the intramolecular interaction and
the intermolecular interaction, we also carried out ns-TR3
experiments of 1 mM KP and 1 mM deoxyguanosine (dA) in
an MeCN solvent (see Figure S1, Supporting Information).
Inspection of Figure S1 indicates that only the Raman signal of
3KP could be detected, the band at 1583 cm−1 is scarcely

However, one may expect that hydrogen bonding and the
pH of an aqueous may be able to strongly aﬀect
the
intramolecular hydrogen abstraction between KP and purine
nucleoside base in the electronic excited state reaction. For
example, the triplet state of KP can undergo a decarboxylation
reaction in aqueous solutions which is consistent with results
from density functional theory (DFT) calculations that show as
more water molecules become involved in the reaction system
the activation energy barriers for the decarboxylation reaction
will decrease.28 These results indicate that water molecules are
able to assist excited state intramolecular proton transfer
(ESIPT) from the carboxylate group to the carbonyl group,
followed by C−C bond cleavage,
loss of CO2 and intra-
molecular charge transfer so that
the triplet protonated
biradical carbanion (3BCH) intermediate appears to be directly
produced from the neutral form of the triplet KP intermediate
by a quick ESIPT and decarboxylation in aqueous solutions.28
Similarly, varying the pH of an aqueous solution can also
signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the decarboxylation reactions of KP so
that an acid assisted decarboxylation takes place in strongly
acidic aqueous
the 2-
acetoxymethyl-2-(3-benzoyl-phenyl)-propionic acid (KP-OAc)
phototrigger compound found that
in neutral high water
concentration or acidic aqueous solution this compound will
exhibit a water and/or acid assisted photodecarboxylation
reaction to directly produce a biradical intermediate that does
not cause release of the OAc− group so that the lifetime of the
intermediate of KP-OAc is similar to that of the
biradical
biradical
intermediate produced from KP in the analogous
solutions.28,32 In contrast
the photo-
types of
decarboxylation of KP-OAc in a phosphate buﬀer solution
(PBS) directly forms the benzylic carbanion intermediate that
can cause the phototrigger reaction to release the OAc− group
so that the lifetime of the biradical intermediate of KP-OAc is
much shorter than the lifetime of the biradical intermediate of
KP in PBS.28,32 The preceding results for KP and KP-OAc in
aqueous solution28,32 of varying pH suggests that hydrogen
bonding between a solvent like water and the KP-purine dyads
may also play a role on the electron transfer and intramolecular
hydrogen abstraction reactions and this should be an interesting
area of investigation in the future for KP-purine dyads and
related systems.

spectra of the triplet state of 5-KP-dG (5-3[KP]-dG) were not

femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy was

of the 5-KP-dA, 3-KP-dA, 5-KPGly-dA dyads are shown in the
Supporting Information and spectra for the 5-KP-dG dyad are
shown in Figure 4. For the four dyads, as the maximum
absorption band around 335 nm rapidly decreases in intensity
and shifts down to a 325 nm band and a weak broad band
around 580 nm also drops in intensity, a strong transient
absorption band promptly arises at 524 nm on the early
picosecond time scale. The bands around 335 and 580 nm are
→ Sn transient absorption and the bands
associated with the S1
→ Tn transient
around 325 and 524 nm are due to the T1
absorption.31,48 The decay dynamics of the 335 nm band is
almost equal to the growth kinetics of the 524 nm band (see
Figure 5 (right)) and this implies that a highly eﬃcient
intersystem crossing (ISC) transforms the singlet state to the
triplet state for the KP moiety of the dyads. Interestingly, for
the 5-KP-dG dyad as the decay of the band at 524 nm occurs, a
small shoulder feature around 545 nm begins to emerge and the
band at 325 nm increases in intensity and shifts up to 329 nm.
The band at 545 nm was assigned to the formation of a ketyl-
sugar biradical intermediate in the aqueous solution,43 and the
fs-TA spectra here indicates that the decay of the 5-3[KP]-dG
dyad leads
to the generation of a ketyl-sugar biradical
intermediate by an intramolecular electron-transfer and/or
intramolecular hydrogen abstraction mechanism.49−51

Figure 5 shows the dynamics of the triplet state for the four
dyads examined in our study. These results show that the
dynamics of the 3-3[KP]-dA and 5-3[KPGly]-dA dyads are
almost same as that of 3KP that do not decay signiﬁcantly
within 3 ns and this is also consistent with the triplet state of
these two dyads being readily detected in the ns-TR3
experiments detailed in the previous section. The decay rate
of the 5-3[KP]-dA dyad with the cisoid structure is observed to
be somewhat faster than that of the 3-3[KP]-dA dyad with the
transoid structure. The 5-3[KP]-dG dyad species exhibits the
fastest decay in intensity compared with the other three dyads.

the intramolecular
is lower than that (23.4 kcal/mol) of
hydrogen abstraction reactions at
the C2 of sugar in the

moiety of 5-3[KP]-dG dyad is easier and faster to be consumed
than that of 5-3[KP]-dA dyad. These calculated results could
reasonably explain the experimental observation that
the
5-3[KP]-dG intermediate decays faster than the 5-3[KP]-dA
intermediate does and also the 5-3[KP]-dG transient could not
be detected in the ns-TR3 experiments whereas the 5-3[KP]-dA
transient could be detected at early nanosecond times in the ns-
TR3 experiments under the same conditions. On the basis of
these calculated results, the hydrogen atoms of C2 and C3 are all

form a radical at the sugar C1, C2, C3 and C4 positions for the 5-
KP-dA and 5-KP-dG dyads. Although the hydrogen atom at the
C2 and C3 positions are easy to be abstracted by the carbonyl
group (O9), the radicals at the C2 and C3 positions possess
higher free energies compared with the ones at the other two
positions. Especially the free energy of the radical at the C1
position is dramatically lower than that of the radical at the C2
position. Our calculation results are reasonably consistent with
the relative stability of the diﬀerent sugar radicals that have
been calculated by several other groups,53−58 and the order is
generally found to be C1 > C4 > C5 > C3 > C2. The lower
energy levels of the sugar radicals at C1 and C4 positions drive
the radicals at the C2 and C3 positions to further isomerize to
the C1 and C4 positions respectively through a hydrogen shift.
As a consequence, the radicals at the C1 and C4 positions are
very stable and should be predominant after
reaching
equilibrium. Kumar and co-workers also reported that for the
neutral sugar radicals of 2′-deoxyguanosine, C1 has the lowest
vertical ionization potential, ca. 6.33 eV in the gas phase. C2 has
the highest vertical ionization potential, ca. 8.02 eV in the gas
phase, and the resultant C2 cation is predicted to undergo a

Among the four dyads, after irradiation the strongest ns-TR3
spectra were recorded for the 5-KP-dG intermediates compared
to other dyads. Therefore, the 5-KP-dG system is used as
model to ascertain the assignment of the transient species and
the vibrational frequencies. Figure 8 shows the comparison of

the ns-TR3 spectrum of 5-KP-dG obtained in MeCN at 10 ns
and the calculated predicted normal Raman spectrum of the
intermediates with one radical at the C1 and C4

ring for 5-KP-dG. The excellent
positions
in the sugar
agreement between these spectra indicates that
the inter-
mediates observed in MeCN for the 5-KP-dG and 5-KP-dA can
be assigned to the ketyl-C1 biradical and ketyl-C4 biradical
species. In several other studies, the C1 sugar radical formation
was also observed predominantly.60−65 Shukla and co-workers
also proposed that one-electron oxidized guanine will form the
C1 sugar radical and another sugar radical at the C3 or C4
positions from visible and UV photolysis.66 The observation of
the ﬁnal 2-deoxyribonolactone (dL) also demonstrated that a
ketyl-C1 biradical intermediate was generated after irradiation
of 5-KP-dG in the presence of oxygen.43 This may support the
abstraction of the hydrogen at C2 position as an initial step by
an intramolecular hydrogen abstraction in the relatively inert
MeCN solvent and subsequently the radical
is inclined to
transfer to the C1 position at a lower energy level. Eventually,
the ketyl-C1 biradical intermediate could react with the oxygen
dissolved in the solvent and generate 5-KP-dL product.43 TD-
DFT calculations were also performed to further characterize
the 5-KP-dL species. These calculation results show that 5-KP-
dL has strong oscillator strengths at 185 and 261 nm. The
higher oscillator strength at 185 nm is mainly contributed from
the sugar chromophore while another low one at 261 nm is
associated with the KP chromophore. Figure S6 shows the
calculated predicted UV−vis absorption of 5-KP-dL. Therefore,
when 319.9 nm was used as the probe wavelength in the ns-
TR3 experiments,
it is very hard to acquire the resonance
Raman spectra of the ﬁnal product due to the deep ultraviolet
absorption of the sugar moiety.

■ CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, a combined experimental/computational study
has provided more insight into the photochemical mechanism
for the generation of ketyl-sugar biradical intermediates among

KP-Purine dyads (Scheme 2), where intramolecular hydrogen
abstraction initiated by the triplet state of the KP moiety leads

Scheme 2. Proposed Photochemical Mechanisms of the KP-
Purine Dyads in MeCN Based on Results from Our Present
Study

to the ketyl-C2 and ketyl-C3 biradical species due to the
accessibility of the carbonyl group to the hydrogen atoms that
are initially abstracted. Both experimental and computational
results show that intramolecular hydrogen abstraction for the
cisoid dyads (5-KP-dA and 5-KP-dG) is favorable in MeCN.
However, the intramolecular hydrogen abstraction is hindered
by the long distance chain for the 5-KPGly-dA system and
steric eﬀect for the transoid structure 3-KP-dA. Therefore, 5-
KPGly-dA and 3-KP-dA show similar photochemistry behavior
as KP in the MeCN solvent. Ketyl-sugar biradical species was
not obviously observed in the ns-TR3 experiments for 5-KPGly-
dA and 3-KP-dA. The kinetics data obtained from fs-TA
experiments in MeCN also provide direct evidence for a slight
decay for the 5-3[KPGly]-dA and 3-3[KP]-dA intermediates
relative to the fast decay for the 5-3[KP]-dA and 5-3[KP]-dG
triplet state cisoid dyads. DFT calculations studies support that
the ketyl-C2 and ketyl-C3 biradicals are ﬁrst formed and then
produce the lower energy level ketyl-C1 and ketyl-C4 biradical
via the radical transferring from the C2 position to the C1
position and from the C3 position to the C4 position through
hydrogen shift processes. Eventually the ketyl-C1 and ketyl-C4
biradical are generated for KP-purine dyads in MeCN solvent.
Given the recent interest in DNA damage and repair reactions,
we believe the current analysis of the intramolecular hydrogen
abstraction between the photosensitive KP moiety and purine
nucleoside moiety in the dyads examined will help encourage
further work into cases where more complicated mechanisms
may be encountered. Furthermore, clear characterization of the
reaction intermediates and an increased understanding of the
reaction mechanisms may also help other researchers in how to
best utilize these types of benzophenone derivative drugs and
to design improved benzophenone derivative drugs
for
particular applications with lower photoxicity.

■ EXPERIMENTAL AND COMPUTATIONAL

METHODS

The four KP-purine nucleoside dyads (5-KP-dA, 3-KP-dA, 5-KP-dG
and 5-KPGly-dA) used in this study were synthesized according to
methods previously reported in the literature.43 The 1H NMR spectra
of
these four dyad samples are provided in the Supporting
Information. The purity of the four KP-purine dyads were estimated
to be ≥98%. The spectroscopic properties of the samples are in full
accord with the literature reported spectra.43

fs-TA Experiments. The fs-TA experiments were done employing
an experimental setup and methods detailed previously31 and only a
brief description is provided here. The fs-TA measurements were done

using a femtosecond regenerative ampliﬁed Ti:sapphire laser system in
which the ampliﬁer was seeded with the 120 fs laser pulses from an
oscillator laser system. The laser probe pulse was produced by utilizing
∼5% of the ampliﬁed 800 nm laser pulses to generate a white-light
continuum (350−800 nm) in a CaF2 crystal and then this probe beam
was split into two parts before traversing the sample. One probe laser
beam went through the sample while the other probe laser beam went
to the reference spectrometer in order to monitor the ﬂuctuations in
the probe beam intensity. For the present experiments, the sample
solution was excited by a 267 nm pump beam (the third harmonic of
the fundamental 800 nm from the regenerative ampliﬁer). The 40 mL
sample solutions were studied in a ﬂowing 2 mm path-length cuvette
with an absorbance of 1 at 267 nm throughout the data acquisition.
ns-TR3 Experiments. The ns-TR3 experiments were done using an
experimental apparatus and methods discussed in detail previously,28
so only a short description will be given here. The 266 nm pump laser
pulse generated from the fourth harmonic of a Nd:YAG nanosecond
pulsed laser and a 319.9 nm probe laser pulse generated from the third
anti-Stokes hydrogen Raman shift laser line from the second harmonic
were used in the ns-TR3 experiments. The energy for the pump and
probe pulses were in the range of 2.5−3.5 mJ with a 10 Hz repetition
rate. The two Nd:YAG lasers were synchronized electronically by a
pulse delay generator to control the delay time of the pump and probe
lasers with the delay time between the laser pulses monitored by a fast
photodiode and 500 MHz oscilloscope and the time resolution for the
ns-TR3 experiments was approximately 10 ns. The pump and probe
laser beams were lightly focused onto the ﬂowing sampling system and
the Raman light was collected using reﬂective optics
into a
spectrometer whose grating dispersed the light onto a liquid nitrogen
cooled CCD detector. The Raman signal was accumulated for 30 s by
the CCD before being read out to an interfaced PC computer and 10−
20 scans of the signal were added together to get a resonance Raman
spectrum. The ns-TR3 spectra presented here were obtained by the
subtraction of a resonance Raman spectrum with negative delay time
of −100 ns (probe-before-pump spectrum) from the resonance Raman
spectrum with a positive delay time (pump−probe spectrum) and the
Raman shifts were calibrated by the known MeCN solvent Raman
bands with an estimated accuracy of 5 cm−1.

DFT Calculations. Density functional theory (DFT) computations
were used to investigate the structure and properties of the likely
intermediates generated after
irradiation of KP-Purine dyads in
acetonitrile solvent. The optimized geometries, vibrational modes
and the vibrational frequencies for the diﬀerent species were obtained
from (U)B3LYP DFT calculations employing a 6-31G* basis set in
PCM solvent model. No imaginary frequency modes were observed at
the stationary states of the optimized structures shown here. All of the
reactions have been explored by optimizing the structures of the
reactant (RC), transition states (TS) and product complexes (PC).
Transition states were located using the Berny algorithm. Frequency
calculations at the same level of theory have also been performed to
identify all of the stationary points as minima for transition states (one
imaginary frequency). Intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRC)67 were
calculated for the transition states to conﬁrm that
the relevant
structures connect the two relevant minima. The Raman spectra were
obtained using the default G03 method that used determination of
Raman intensities
from transition polarizabilities calculated by
numerical diﬀerentiation, with assumed zero excitation frequency
(e.g., using the Placzek approximation). The calculated Raman
frequencies from the UB3LYP/6-311G** computations were scaled
by a factor of 0.975 to compare with the experimental Raman results in
order to make vibrational assignments. All of the calculations were
done using the Gaussian 03 program suite.68
