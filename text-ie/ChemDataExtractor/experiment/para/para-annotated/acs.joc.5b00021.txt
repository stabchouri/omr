ABSTRACT: The preparation, X-ray structure, and optoelectronic proper-
ties of bis(diarylmethylene)dihydrothiophene 1 and its π-extended analogues
2 are described. The development of a simple, short-step synthetic route
allowed us to prepare derivatives with diﬀerent aryl units. X-ray crystallo-
graphic analysis of 1b and 2b revealed their quinoidal structures, which exhibit
strong electronic absorption in the visible region. Cyclic voltammetry
measurements revealed their strong electron-donating properties. 1b showed
two-step electrochromic behavior between the corresponding radical cation
and dication.

Q uinoidal compounds have attracted considerable

attention with respect to their reactivity and diradical
the simplest
character. For example, o-quinodimethane,
shows high reactivity.1 Recently, π-
quinoidal molecule,
conjugated quinoidal molecules with diradical character have
been reported to show low-energy light absorption that reached
to the near-infrared (NIR) region.2

Polythiophene,3 thienothiophene, and their derivatives, such
as P3HT4 and BTBT,5 have been extensively studied from the
viewpoint of conducting organic materials in hole-transporting
materials for use in organic ﬁeld-eﬀect transistors6 and bulk
heterojunction solar cells.7 Polythiophene derivatives are
characterized by strong electron-donating properties and a
narrower HOMO−LUMO gap due to the long π-conjugation
of electron-donating thiophene units. The relationships
between the number of thiophene rings and photophysical
and/or electronic properties have been extensively studied with
oligothiophene derivatives.8

On the basis of the unique properties of quinoidal molecules
and oligothiophene and/or thienothiophene, quinoidal oligo-
thiophene should be an interesting structural motif with regard
to its electronic, photonic, and diradical characteristics. In fact,
quinoidal oligothiophene and thienothiophene with dicyano-
methylene groups have been extensively studied as organic
conductors,9 optical materials,10 and organic ﬁeld-eﬀect
transistors.11 For example, Otsubo et al.
studied an
oligothiophene with a dicyanomethylene group up to a
hexamer and reported amphoteric redox behavior and the
emergence of a diradical character with extension of
the
framework.12 Dihydrothienothiophenes with
thienoquinoidal
dicyanomethylene units have also been prepared for examina-
tion of their photophysical and conductive properties.13 While
quinoidal oligothiophenes and thienothiophene with electron-
withdrawing dicyanomethylene units have been extensively

examined, little is known about those with electron-donating
substituents. Although bis(diphenylmethylene)dihydrothio-
phene 1a and its π-extended analogue have been reported
sporadically,14 their molecular structures and their optical and
electronic properties have not been well examined.

In this work, we prepared bis(diarylmethylene)dihydrothio-
phene 1 and its π-extended analogues 2 by a simple and
versatile synthetic route. Because quinoidal bithiophene with
diphenylmethylene groups has been reported to isomerize in
solution,15 we chose thienothiophene instead to expand the
thiophene core. X-ray structural analysis of 1 and 2 revealed
their quinoidal molecular structure. Extension of a π-electron
unit and the manipulation of electron-donating and -accepting
groups on an aryl group strongly aﬀect their absorption spectra.
With regard to the electrochemistry of
these derivatives,
diﬀerent redox behaviors were observed depending on the
electron-donating and -accepting properties on the terminal
aryl group. Compound 1b with a simple molecular structure
showed tricolor electrochromic behavior.

We ﬁrst sought to identify an eﬃcient synthetic route for 1
and 2. It has been reported that ﬂuorene-fused dihydrothieno-
thiophene with a quinoidal molecular structure could be
synthesized from the corresponding diol by dehydration in the
solid state or in a photochemical reaction and from the
corresponding dihydro derivative by deprotonation followed by
oxidation.14c However, some of these reactions require extreme
reaction conditions. Nakayama et al. reported the preparation
of 1a−c from the corresponding dication species.14b However,
during the course of our studies, we found that these cations

Single-crystal X-ray crystallographic analyses and DFT
calculations were performed for neutral donors 1 and 2 and
their respective dicationic states 12+ and 22+ to examine their
molecular structures. Figure 1 shows ORTEP drawings of 1b
and 2b and optimized structures for 1b2+ and 2b2+. Crystal data,
data collection, and reduction parameters for crystals 1a, 1b, 2a,
and 2b and selected bond lengths and torsion angles of 1a, 1b,
and 2b are summarized in Table 2 and Table S1 of the
Supporting Information. The bond length was successfully
determined with a high degree of accuracy in the crystal
structures of 1a, 1b, and 2b, which allowed us to examine the
bonding characteristics of these compounds. Because disorder
in the thienothiophene ring of 2a made it diﬃcult to determine
the precise bond lengths, structural data for 2a were excluded

the formation of a quinoidal structure, which is consistent with
the optimized molecular
structure obtained using DFT
calculations (see Tables S2 and S3 of
the Supporting
Information). The terminal aryl moieties and central thiophene
ring are twisted because of steric repulsion between hydrogens
on the aryl group and hydrogen or sulfur on the thiophene ring.
Dicationic species 12+ and 22+ are relatively unstable toward
moisture, which made it diﬃcult to grow a single crystal that
was suitable for X-ray analysis. Thus, we performed DFT
calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. In contrast
−CB bonds in
to those of neutral donors 1 and 2, the CA

dications 12+ and 22+ are longer than the CB

molecular structure. This switching of the quinoid−benzenoid
structure based on electron transfer should be interesting with
regard to the change in photophysical properties.

Next, we examined photophysical properties. Figure 2 shows
UV−vis and ﬂuorescence spectra of 1 and 2 in dichloro-
methane. Thienoquinoid 1a showed strong absorption in the
visible region at 422 nm, which can be assigned to the
HOMO−LUMO transition of the thienoquinoid substructure,
which was supported by DFT calculations [B3LYP/6-31G(d)
(see Figure 3)]. Extension of the central π-electron unit from a
thienoquinoid unit to a thienothienoquinoid unit caused a huge
red shift of 44 nm for 2a in contrast to that of 1a due to
narrowing of the HOMO−LUMO gap through the extension
of π-conjugation. The absorption spectra of 1 and 2 were also
strongly aﬀected by the substituents on the terminal aryl
moieties. The introduction of both electron-donating methoxy
units and electron-accepting chloro atoms on phenyl moieties
caused a red shift. Table 1 summarizes the energy levels of

showed moderate instability toward moisture, which hampered
their puriﬁcation.
<para sub="scope">
Thus, we developed a simple, versatile synthetic route for 1,
as summarized in Scheme 1. The addition of diarylketone to
dilithiothiophene generated from dibromothiophene gave the
corresponding diol 3. Diols 3b and 3c were puriﬁed by silica gel
column chromatography, whereas phenyl derivative 3a′ was
isolated as an ethoxy derivative after recrystallization of the
crude product from ethanol. In the previous paper,14b the
dication was generated from the corresponding diol by the
reaction with Brønsted acidic medium consisting of aq HClO4
in acetic anhydride, which cannot be easily removed because of
the low volatility of the reagents. Thus, we chose a Lewis acid,
TMSClO4, with 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaﬂuoro-2-propanol (HFIP) as a
solvent
to generate the corresponding dicationic species,
because all of the reagent and solvent could be removed by
evaporation,16 which allowed us to reduce the dicationic species
in situ. Treatment of the diol with TMSClO4 in HFIP followed
by reduction of the generated dicationic species with Zn in
MeCN successfully gave the corresponding thienoquinoid 1.
The dication could also be obtained from ethoxy derivative 3a′,
which was reduced to give 1a. The versatility of this route was
demonstrated by the preparation of 1b, 1c, and 2a−c, which
have diﬀerent aryl moieties and/or thiophene units. Electron-
donating aryl moieties and an electron-deﬁcient aryl group can
be introduced by this method. Notably, the yield of 1c was
drastically improved from 6% with HClO4 and Ac2O14b to 99%
with TMSClO4 and HFIP. While extension of the thiophene
unit to thienothiophene was also successfully demonstrated, the
introduction of a stronger electron-donating aryl unit such as
Me2NC6H4 and further extension of the thiophene spacer such
as dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]thiophene failed. Because of the strong
electron-donating properties of 1b and 2a (vide infra), these
quinoid compounds should be oxidized and decompose during
workup and puriﬁcation.

HOMO and LUMO for 1 and 2. While the introduction of an
electron-donating methoxy group increased the HOMO energy
more than the LUMO energy, an electron-accepting chloro
atom decreased the LUMO energy more than the HOMO
energy. As a result, the HOMO−LUMO gap narrowed in both
cases to cause a signiﬁcant red shift in 1 and 2. Compounds 1
and 2 exhibited weak ﬂuorescence in solution. The tendency of
the wavelength of emission maxima was in accord with that of
absorption maxima. Thienoquinoid 1 showed ﬂuorescence also
in the solid state (Figure S4 of the Supporting Information).

<para sub=“props”>
Electrochemical properties were examined by cyclic
voltammetry (CV). Figure S1 of the Supporting Information
shows a CV chart for 1b and 2b. Both compounds showed
reversible one-wave two-electron oxidation waves, which
correspond to the generation of the dication species. The
oxidation potentials of 1b and 2b were 0.64 and 0.56 V versus
Ag/AgCl, respectively, which correspond to HOMO energies
of −4.83 and −4.73 eV, respectively, which demonstrates
strong electron-donating properties. The oxidation potential
could be tuned by not only the length of the thienoquinoid π-
system but also the substituents on the aryl group. The less
electron-rich phenyl derivative and 4-chlorophenyl derivative
showed irreversible one-wave oxidation waves at 0.98 (1a), 0.83
(2a), 1.13 (1c), and 0.94 V (2c),
indicating the facile
decomposition of cation radical species in an electron-poor

properties, the conjugation eﬀect of the methoxy group in 1b

<para sub=“props”>
We examined the electrochromic17,18 behavior of 1b. Figure
4 shows changes in the UV−vis spectra of 1b upon constant-
current oxidation, where two-stage electrochromic behaviors
were observed. In the early stage of oxidation, the absorption
intensity corresponding to neutral species 1b decreased,
whereas the new long-wave absorption intensity at ∼645 nm
increased. The absorption intensity of a new low-energy
absorption band remained constant even as electrolysis
proceeded. In the later stage, this absorption was suppressed
with a continuous decrease in the absorption intensity of the
intermediate, whereas the intensity of a new strong absorption
peak at ∼500 nm increased. Because 1b2+ was expected to show
absorption at ∼500 nm based on TDDFT calculations at the
B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory, this change in the UV−vis
spectrum should correspond to stepwise oxidation to dication
1b2+ via cation radical intermediate 1b+•
. It is interesting to
compare the electrochromic behavior to that of bis[di(4-
methoxyphenyl)ethenyl]thiophene, which has an additional
conjugated carbon and shows bicolor electrochromism between
the neutral state and dication state.19 The diﬀerence in
electrochromic behavior could probably be ascribed to the
diﬀerence in the degree of interaction between the terminal
redox active diarylmethylene unit, which was directly connected
to a thiophene π-spacer in 1b and resulted in weak electronic
coupling to show two-step electrochromism. On the other
hand, diarylmethylene units were separated by two additional
carbon units in bis[di(4-methoxyphenyl)ethenyl]thiophene,
and the electronic coupling between terminal units was
negligible for the achievement of bicolor electrochromism. A
tricolor change could be triggered by two diﬀerent mechanisms,
i.e., a change in the electronic nature of the thienoquinoid π-
unit and a change in the chromophore from thienoquinoid to
triarylmethylium.

■ CONCLUSION

In summary, we have developed a versatile synthetic route for
bis(diarylmethylene)dihydrothiophene 1. The versatility of this
method was demonstrated by the derivatization of aryl moieties
and π-extension of a thiophene unit. X-ray crystallographic
analysis of 1 and 2 revealed their quinoidal molecular
structures. The electronic absorption spectra of compounds 1
and 2 were strongly aﬀected by the π-conjugation length and
the presence of electron-donating and/or electron-accepting
substituents on the aryl groups. While electron-poor molecules
1a, 2a, 1c, and 2c were unstable toward electrochemical
oxidation, molecules 1b and 2b with an electron-donating 4-
methoxyphenyl group showed reversible redox behavior
between dication species via the corresponding cation radical.
This oxidation process can be monitored by UV−vis spectra to
show tricolor electrochromic behavior. Redox active quinoidal
molecules with switching ability20 should be an interesting
molecular system, which may be useful
in optoelectronic
materials.

<para sub=“exp”>
General Methods. All chemical reactions were performed under a
nitrogen atmosphere. Commercially available reagents and solvents
were used without further puriﬁcation. TMSClO4 in toluene was
prepared according to a literature method.16 Chemical shifts (δ) in
parts per million were referenced to an internal
standard of
tetramethylsilane or residual nondeuterated solvent (1H at 5.32 ppm
for CD2Cl2 and 13C at 77.0 ppm for CDCl3). Mass spectra were
obtained in EI mode with a magnetic sector mass spectrometer.
Infrared (IR, 400−4000 cm−1) spectra were measured on a KBr pellet
with a resolution of 4 cm−1.

X-ray Structural Analysis. Temperature-dependent crystallo-
graphic data (Table 2) were collected using a diﬀractometer equipped
with a rotating anode ﬁt with multilayer confocal optics using Cu Kα
(λ = 1.54187 Å) radiation. Structural reﬁnements were conducted
using the full-matrix least-squares method on F2. Calculations were
performed using the Crystal Structure and SHELEX software
packages.21 Parameters were reﬁned using anisotropic temperature
factors except for the hydrogen atom.
