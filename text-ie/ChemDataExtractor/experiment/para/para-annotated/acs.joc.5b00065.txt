ABSTRACT: A platinum(II)-catalyzed asymmetric ring opening of oxabenzonorbornadienes with phenols was developed,
which aﬀorded the corresponding cis-2-(un)substituted phenoxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalen-1-ol products rather than the trans ones
in excellent yields (up to 99%) with moderate to good enantioselectivities (up to 87% ee) under mild conditions. In addition, the
cis-conﬁguration of product 2b was conﬁrmed by X-ray diﬀraction analysis. Based on the results, a potential mechanism for the
present catalytic reaction was proposed.

■ INTRODUCTION

Transition-metal-catalyzed asymmetric ring-opening (ARO)
reactions of oxa- and azabicyclic alkenes are an eﬃcient and
enantioselective synthetic strategy for generating a hydro-
naphthalene skeleton which could be further transformed into
optical compounds found in a wide range of pharmacological
agents.1 Transition-metal catalysts were often applied in the
carbon−carbon and carbon−heteroatom bond-forming pro-
cesses to provide more than one stereocenter in a single step.2
Many metal catalysts, consisting of Rh,3 Ir,4 Pd,5 Ni,6 Fe,7 Cu,8
etc., have been investigated for ring-opening reactions with
various carbanion nucleophiles and heteroatom nucleophiles.
Lautens et al.,3a Yang et al.,4f,g and Fan et al.9 reported the
rhodium- and iridium-catalyzed ARO of oxa- and azabicyclic
alkenes with phenol nucleophiles, with C−O or C−N bonds
successfully generated. The products were obtained through an
SN2′ nucleophilic displacement of the bridgehead leaving group
with inversion to give the 1,2-trans ring-opening products in
high yields with excellent enantioselectivities. However, the
formation of cis-2-phenoxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalen-1-ol prod-
ucts has not been reported yet. In addition, the rhodium and
iridium catalyst systems show less compatibility with electron-
rich substrates. Against the above background, this work aimed
to develop a Pt-catalyzed system for
the ARO of
oxabenzonorbornadienes with phenols, one that is comple-

mentary to the rhodium,3a iridium,4f,g,9 and platinum10 catalyst
systems.

Our group has studied the transition-metal-catalyzed ARO of
oxa- and azabenzonorbornadienes with manifold nucleophiles
extensively. We previously reported the iridium-catalyzed ARO
of oxa- and azabicyclic alkenes with a variety of nucleophiles,
including amines,4a−e alcohols,4i and phenols,4f−h aﬀording the
corresponding 1,2-trans ring-opening products in high yields
with good enantioselectivities. Recently, our group reported the
Pt-catalyzed ARO of oxabicyclic alkenes with carbanion
including organoboronic acids,10a Grignard
nucleophiles,
reagents,10b and terminal alkynes,10c producing the correspond-
ing ring-opening products in good to excellent yields with good
enantioselectivities. Given the successes with the platinum
catalyst system, we sought
the
platinum(II)-catalyzed ARO to heteroatom nucleophiles.
Although phenolic nucleophiles have been successfully used
in rhodium- and iridium-catalyzed ARO reactions, platinum
never has been used as a catalyst with this class of nucleophiles,
nor could we obtain the cis-2-phenoxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalen-
1-ol products.

1,2-cis ring-opening products in high yields with moderate to
good enantioselectivities. Compared with the iridium catalyst
system,4g,9 the ring-opening reactions of
the electron-rich
substrates catalyzed by platinum oﬀered much better yields (up
to 99%). The cis-conﬁguration of product 2b was conﬁrmed by
X-ray diﬀraction analysis.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
Substrates 1a−d were readily prepared by the Diels−Alder
reaction of benzynes with furan according to literature
procedures.11 Our
investigation began by treating
oxabenzonorbornadiene 1a with phenol
in the presence of
complex Pt(COD)Cl2 (COD = 1,5-cyclo-octadiene) and
bisphosphine ligand, using AgSbF6 as the additive and 1,2-
dichloroethane (DCE) as the solvent at 50 °C. We could obtain
the desired ring-opening product 2a in a good yield (89%) after
20 h when an achiral bisphosphine ligand 1,3-bis-
(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP) was ﬁrst used to validate
the catalytic activity of the platinum complex in the ARO
reaction of 1a with phenol. The inspiring results impelled us to
investigate bisphosphine ligands with diﬀerent chiral backbones
using Pt(COD)Cl2 as the catalyst precursor. When (S)-BINAP
(Table 1, entry 2) and (S)-p-Tol-BINAP (Table 1, entry 3)
were used as the ligands,
they gave similar yields and
enantioselectivities. Several other chiral
including
(S,S)-ME-DUPHOS, (R)-(S)-PPF-PtBu2, and (S)-MOFPHOS,
were then examined, but
these ligands gave unsatisfactory
results in both yields and enantioselectivities (Table 1, entries
4−6). When SEGPHOS-type ligands were used, (S)-DM-
SEGPHOS generated 2a in 86% yield with 70% ee (Table 1,
entry 8), whereas (S)-SEGPHOS gave lower yield (63%) but
slightly better ee value (73%) (Table 1, entry 7). To achieve
better yield and enantioselectivity, a bulkier ligand (S)-DTBM-
SEGPHOS was tried. The enantioselectivity of product 2a was
improved to 80% ee but with moderate yield (Table 1, entry 9).
Based on these results, we chose (S)-DM-SEGPHOS as the
ligand for the reaction. We next explored the eﬀect of catalyst
loading on the reaction. The results in Table 1 indicate that the
loading has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the product’s
catalyst
enantioselectivity. The yields were maintained at good levels
with enantiomer excesses increasing from 70 to 89% with
decreasing catalyst loadings from 5.0 to 1.0 mol % (Table 1,
entries 8 and 10−13). Based on the results, a catalyst loading of
1.5 mol % of Pt(COD)Cl2 with 1.5 mol % of (S)-DM-
SEGPHOS (Table 1, entry 8) was chosen as the optimum
condition in terms of yield and enantioselectivity.

ligands,
<para sub=“opt”>
To optimize the reaction conditions, the eﬀects of additives,
solvents, bases, and temperature on the reactivity and
enantioselectivity were subsequently investigated (Table 2).
We initially used AgSbF6 as the additive in the platinum-
catalyzed ARO reaction. The yields increased by 30% in
contrast to those without AgSbF6 (Table 2, entries 1 and 9). To
obtain better results, several other AgX (X = BF4, OTf, PF6,
ClO4) salts were then tested (Table 2, entries 2−5), but no
better yields and enatioselectivities were achieved. In addition,
other additives of Lewis acids, such as KSbF6 and ZnCl2, were
investigated (Table 2, entries 6 and 7). The results showed that
AgSbF6 was the best one. Thereafter, the eﬀect of molar ratio of
Pt(COD)Cl2/AgX was also investigated. The best result was
obtained when the molar ratio of Pt(COD)Cl2/AgSbF6 was 1:2
(Table 2, entry 1). Control experiments revealed that the yields

The eﬀect of solvents was then examined (Table 2, entries

inﬂuence on the yield. To our surprise, no expected product

was carried out in tetrahydrofuran (THF), which is a good
solvent for the Rh- and Ir-catalyzed ARO reactions.3a,4g In
addition, reactions in the solvents of CH3OH, CH3CN, and
toluene gave poor yields but good enantioselectivities (Table 2,

(Table 2, entry 14). The reaction in CH2Cl2 proceeded
relatively faster with slightly lower enantioselectivity than in
DCE (Table 2, entry 15). The results indicate that DCE shows
the best combination of reactivity and enantioselectivity among
all the solvents tested (85% yield, 80% ee) (Table 2, entry 1).
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
After exploring the eﬀect of solvents, we turned our
attentions to the choice of the bases. No reaction took place
without bases present (not shown in Table 2). Moderate yields
and enantioselectivities were obtained when CsF, K3PO4, and
K2CO3 aqueous solution were used (Table 2, entries 16−18).
As we added organic base tBuOK, the reaction also proceeded
to give the desired product 2a in 58% yield with 73% ee (Table
2, entry 19). We also tried potassium phenolate as the
nucleophile instead of phenol and KOH solution, and no
reaction took place. The results indicated that KOH was the
best base for
reaction system (Table 2, entry 1).
Furthermore, the reaction temperature optimization indicated
that 50 °C was the optimum reaction temperature in terms of
yield and enantioselectivity (Table 2, entries 20 and 21). Based
on the above results, the standard reaction conditions for the
reaction were identiﬁed as follows: 1.5 mol % of Pt(COD)Cl2/
(S)-DM-SEGPHOS, 5.0 equiv of phenols, 3.0 mol % of
AgSbF6, and 0.05 equiv of KOH (0.5 M in H2O) in DCE at 50

Table 3, we can see that a number of phenols and naphthols
reacted smoothly with 1a and generated the corresponding 1,2-
cis ring-opening products with moderate to good enantiose-
lectivities. The results also revealed that the electronic property
of the substituents on the aromatic rings has a crucial inﬂuence
on the enantioselectivity. Phenols with electron-donating
substituents gave yields relatively higher and better enantiose-
lectivities (Table 3, entries 2−6) than those with electron-
withdrawing substituents (Table 3, entries 7−11). In general,
the higher the pKa value of the phenol, the higher the yield and
≈ 9.9) oﬀered
the enantioselectivity. For example, phenol (pKa
≈ 8.5) gave
85% yield and 80% ee, while 4-chlorophenol (pKa
72% yield and 23% ee (Table 3, entries 1 and 7). When it came
to the positional property of the substituents on the aromatic
ring for the nucleophile reagents, we noted that the asymmetric
ring opening of 1a with the meta-substituted phenols oﬀered
better yields but lower enantioselectivities than those with para-
and ortho-substituted phenols (Table 3, entries 2−4 and 7−9).
Although the ortho-substituted phenols led to relatively inferior
yields, surprisingly good enantioselectivities were obtained. For
instance, 2-chlorophenol and 2-methylphenol gave products 2d
and 2i in moderate yields with good ee values (84 and 75% ee,
respectively) (Table 3, entries 4 and 9). The reaction

the nucleophile, achieving 71% yield with only 35% ee (Table
3, entry 10). As
the phenol with the strong electron-
withdrawing acetyl group was used as the nucleophile, the
corresponding product 2k was obtained in 54% yield with 72%
ee (Table 3, entry 11). For biphenyl-4-ol and 2-naphthol, ring-
opening products 2l and 2m were produced in dramatically
diﬀerent yields (84 and 40%, respectively) and ee values (87

having disubstituted groups also showed good reactivity with
moderate to good enantioselectivity (Table 3, entries 14−17).
The reactions of 1a with phenols containing electron-donating
multisubstituted groups gave the corresponding products 2n
and 2p in good yields with moderate to good ee values (Table
3, entries 14 and 16), while 2,4-dichlorophenol gave 42% yield
and 60% ee (Table 3, entry 15). Due to the steric bulkiness of
the tert-butyl groups, the ring-opening reaction of 1a with 2,6-
di-tert-butylphenol did not aﬀord any desired product (Table 3,
entry 18). In one competition experiment, 5 equiv of 4-
methoxylphenol and 4-chlorophenol was used as

phenols proceeded smoothly to give the expected products in
high yields (up to 99%) with moderate to good enantiose-
lectivities (up to 84% ee). Compared with results from a
previous study,4g electron-rich substrate 1b gave much more
favorable results than electron-deﬁcient substrate 1c in the
platinum catalyst system (Table 4, entries 1−13), while the
electron-rich substrate gave ring-opening products in moderate
yields and the electron-deﬁcient substrate oﬀered good results
in the Ir catalyst system. The ARO of 1b with phenols bearing
the electron-donating methyl and methoxy groups showed
higher ee values than those bearing the electron-withdrawing Cl
group (Table 4, entries 1−5). Moreover, the meta-substituted
phenols, such as 3-methylphenol and 3-chlorophenol, aﬀorded
the corresponding products 3b and 3e in better yields (99 and
96%, respectively) but slightly lower enantioselectivities (76
and 45% ee, respectively) than those with para- and ortho-
substituents (Table 4, entries 2−4 and 7−9). Phenols involving
disubstituted groups also showed good reactivity and moderate
to good enantioselectivity (Table 4, entries 6−8). It was
noteworthy that the 2,4-dimethylphenol gave good ee value
(84%) (Table 4, entry 6) compared to those that are bulky and
less sterically demanding (Table 4, entries 7 and 8). The
reactions of electron-poor 1c with phenols required much
longer reaction time and gave lower yields with inferior ee
values when compared with electron-rich 1b (Table 4, entries

obtained in moderate yield (54%) with 78% ee (Table 4, entry
9). As 4-chloro-3-methylphenol was used as the nucleophile,
the reaction aﬀorded the corresponding product 4e in
moderate yield with very low ee value (Table 4, entry 13).
Besides, bulkier substrate 1d achieved the ring-opening product
5a in 91% yield with only 28% ee (Table 4, entry 14).

The stereochemistry of 1,2-cis ring-opened product 2b was
unambiguously conﬁrmed by X-ray crystallography. The single-
crystal analysis of 2b was achieved by solvent evaporation from
a mixture of hexane, ethyl acetate, and CHCl3. Its absolute
conﬁguration was assigned as (1S,2R) and conﬁrmed as 1,2-cis-
conﬁguration, as revealed in the Supporting Information.
Furthermore, compared with the NMR spectroscopy of 1,2-
trans-conﬁguration ring-opened products,
there were some

chemical shift changes
spectroscopy of 1,2-cis ring-opened products. The chemical
shifts of the H1, H2 or C1, C2 in 1,2-cis ring-opened products
generally decreased from left to right. To be speciﬁc, the δ value
ranges for 1,2-dihydrogen (H1, H2) of 1,2-trans ring-opened
products are 5.33−5.07 and 5.22−4.98 ppm, respectively, and
those for H1, H2 of 1,2-cis ring-opened products are 5.26−4.84
and 5.12−4.82 ppm, respectively. Besides, changes in 13C{1H}
NMR spectroscopy are observed in chemical shifts, as well. The
C1 and C2 of NMR spectroscopy (69.8−56.2 and 76.7−61.6
ppm, respectively) of 1,2-cis ring-opened products occurred at
lower ﬁeld ranges than the C1, C2 (72.9−64.9 and 84.5−74.1
ppm, respectively) of 1,2-trans ring-opened products.4g That
would be another way to distinguish the 1,2-cis from 1,2-trans
ring-opened products.

■ CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a platinum(II)-
catalyzed ARO of oxabenzonorbornadienes with a variety of
phenols to prepare 1,2-cis ring-opening products in good to
excellent yields with moderate to good enantioselectivities. In
addition, we have also successfully optimized suitable reaction
conditions for the ARO reaction of oxabicyclic alkenes with

to rhodium- and iridium-catalyzed
protocols,
this platinum catalyst system displayed higher
catalytic activity toward electron-rich substrates with yields up
to 99%. Most noteworthy,
instead of generating 1,2-trans
products generally observed in the Rh- and Ir-catalyzed ARO
reactions, we could obtain the cis-2-(un)substituted phenoxy-
1,2-dihydronaphthalen-1-ol products via the platinum(II)-
catalyzed ARO of oxabenzonorbornadienes with phenols,
which would be an excellent complement to the Rh-, Ir-, and
Pt-catalyzed ARO chemistry. Studies on further expansion of
the scopes and synthetic utilities of the Pt-catalyzed ring-
opening reaction are being pursued and will be reported in due
course.

General Procedure for the Platinum(II)-Catalyzed ARO
Reactions of Oxabenzonorbornadienes 1a−d with Phenols.
A 10 mL round-bottom ﬂask ﬁtted with a reﬂux condenser was ﬂame-
dried under a stream of nitrogen and cooled to room temperature.
Pt(COD)Cl2 (1.1 mg, 1.5 mol %) and (S)-DM-SEGPHOS (2.2 mg,
1.5 mol %) were simultaneously added followed by the addition of
DCE (2.0 mL). After the mixture was stirred for about 20 min, AgSbF6
(2.1 mg, 3.0 mol %) was added. After another 10 min,
oxabenzonorbornadienes (0.2 mmol) and phenols (1.0 mmol) were
added and followed by KOH solution (0.5 M in H2O, 20 μL). The
reaction was stirred at 50 °C until completion as monitored by thin
layer chromatography. After the reaction mixture was cooled to room

temperature, the solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude mixture
was then poured into 10 mL of dichloromethane and washed three
times (3 × 10 mL) with 5% aqueous NaOH. The aqueous layers were
combined and back-extracted three times (3 × 10 mL) with CH2Cl2.
The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and
then ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was concentrated in vacuum, and the
resulting residue was puriﬁed on a silica gel column (silica gel: 200−
300 mesh) using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether as eluent to aﬀord the
desired products.
