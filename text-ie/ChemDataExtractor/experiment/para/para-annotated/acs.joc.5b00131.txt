ABSTRACT: We have developed a one-pot O-sulﬁnative
Passerini/oxidation reaction,
in which a combination of an
aldehyde, an isocyanide, and a sulﬁnic acid react, followed by
the addition of mCPBA as an oxidant
to give the
corresponding α-(sulfonyloxy)amides in high yields. This
reaction is the ﬁrst reported demonstration of an isocyanide-
based multicomponent reaction using a sulﬁnic acid in place of a carboxylic acid. A wide range of aldehydes and isocyanides are
applicable to this reaction.

M ulticomponent reactions of

isocyanides, such as the
Passerini and Ugi reactions, are very useful synthetic
tools for the construction of diverse complex molecules. The
Passerini reaction, in particular, has been found useful for the
construction of polyfunctional molecules such as α-acylox-
yamide in a practical, one-pot process. Since Passerini’s
development of this multicomponent reaction in 1921,1 various
modiﬁcations have been reported,2 although it is only recently
that other species have been substituted for carboxylic acid.
Typically, a carboxylic acid is a crucial component of the
mixture due to the speciﬁc mechanism by which the Passerini
reaction progresses. This mechanism, which has been widely
studied, appears to involve activation of an aldehyde by the
carboxylic acid,
followed by addition of an isocyanide and
trapping of
the resulting nitrilium intermediate by the
carboxylate to aﬀord the ﬁnal product by migration of the
acyl group onto the oxygen atom derived from the aldehyde.
Therefore,
the presence of carboxylic acid is generally a
necessity during the reaction of an isocyanide with an aldehyde,
or with an imine, as in the Ugi reaction. This requirement for a
carboxylic acid unfortunately limits the application of
this
reaction to the synthesis of a narrow range of molecules.
Several examples using other components in place of carboxylic
acids have been reported to date. One example is the O-
arylative Passerini
reaction using nitrophenol derivatives,
developed by El Kaim and Grimaud in 2006.3 A direct
alkylative Passerini reaction of an aldehyde, an isocyanide, and a
free aliphatic alcohol, catalyzed by In(III), was reported by
Taguchi.4 Acetals and ketals are also useful for the reaction of
isocyanides when catalyzed by Lewis or Brønsted acids,
aﬀording α-alkoxyimidates.5 Because, as described above, the
acyl group of a carboxylic acid acts as an electrophile while its
OH group acts as a nucleophile for the nitrilium intermediate,
other molecules containing both electrophilic and nucleophilic
groups (Z−OH) could potentially act in a similar manner to a
carboxylic acid in the Passerini
reaction. Based on this
hypothesis, we previously developed an O-silylative Passerini

reaction, borinic-acid-catalyzed α-addition of an isocyanide, and
an O-phosphinative Passerini reaction (Scheme 1).6 In this
work, we demonstrated the use of sulﬁnic acid as a carboxylic
acid equivalent
to aﬀord the desired products from three
components.

Scheme 1. O-Silylative Passerini Reaction, O-Phosphinative
Passerini Reaction, and Borinic Acid Catalyzed α-Addition
of an Isocyanide

We initially examined whether sulﬁnic acid was capable of
participating in a three-component coupling reaction with an
aldehyde and an isocyanide to aﬀord the corresponding α-
(sulﬁnyloxy)amide (eq 1, step 1). We further investigated the
reaction of the resulting α-(sulﬁnyloxy)amide with an oxidizing
reagent to generate α-(sulfonyloxy)amide derivatives in a one-
pot operation (eq 1, step 2). Generally, α-(sulfonyloxy)alkanoic
acid derivatives are important precursors of α-amino acids.7 In
addition, α-(sulfonyloxy)amides may be useful as useful
building blocks in SN2 reactions to convert other functional
groups.

hydrolysis product 5aa6c was also obtained in 20% yield. When
1.0 equiv of isocyanide and 2.0 equiv of sulﬁnic acid were used,
4aaa was obtained in 50% yield, but the yield of 5aa increased
to 49% (entry 2). The hydrolysis side reaction was suppressed
using 1.5 equiv of isocyanide and 2.0 equiv of sulﬁnic acid,
giving the desired 4aaa in 79% yield as well as 5aa in 11% yield
(entry 3). Finally, we were pleased to observe that 4aaa was
obtained in 87% yield, while the yield of 5aa was decreased to
8%, when 2 equiv of 2a were used (entry 4). This reaction
proceeded eﬃciently in both toluene and diethyl ether to aﬀord
4aaa in high yields (entries 5 and 6). Use of the cyclic ether
THF as a solvent was less eﬀective, resulting in the formation of
α-hydroxyamide 5aa in 27% yield, probably due to hydrolysis of
4aaa (entry 7). Methanol, which has been used in the Ugi
reaction as a protic solvent, produced a very sluggish reaction
from which only 5aa was obtained in 20% yield after 24 h
(entry 8).

optimal amounts of aldehydes 1a−i (1.0 equiv) and isocyanides
2a−h (2.0 equiv) were used in the presence of 2.0 equiv of (4-

conditions allow the reaction to proceed when using a wide
variety of aliphatic aldehydes and isocyanides and that most

isocyanides (R2 = t-Oct, c-Hex, and Bn) with 1a and 3a gave

■ CONCLUSION

In summary, we have developed a one-pot O-sulﬁnative
Passerini/oxidation reaction,
in which a combination of an
aldehyde, an isocyanide, and a sulﬁnic acid react, followed by
addition of mCPBA as an oxidant to give the corresponding α-
(sulfonyloxy)amides in high yields. This reaction is the ﬁrst
reported demonstration of an isocyanide-based multicompo-
nent reaction using a sulﬁnic acid in place of a carboxylic acid. A
wide range of aldehydes and isocyanides are applicable to this
reaction.

General Method. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz
NMR spectrometer. Chemical shifts δ are reported in ppm using TMS
as an internal standard. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift,
multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m =
multiplet), coupling constant (J), and integration. 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a 100 MHz NMR spectrometer. The chemical shifts
were determined in the δ-scale relative to CDCl3 (δ = 77.0 ppm). The
wave numbers of maximum absorption peaks of IR spectroscopy are
presented in cm−1. HRMS (DART) was measured with a quadrupole
and TOF mass spectrometers. All melting points were measured using
a micro melting point apparatus. Dehydrated solvents were purchased
for the reactions and used without further desiccation.

with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was separated. The organic
layer was washed with water and brine, dried over Na2SO4,
concentrated, and puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatography.
