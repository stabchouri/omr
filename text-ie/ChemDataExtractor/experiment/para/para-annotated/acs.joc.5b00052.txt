ABSTRACT: A synthesis of dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrroles
fused with two peripheral arenes or heterocyclic units has been
realized through the concise route. These nearly planar
compounds were prepared starting from assembling the
central core via condensation of 2-aryl or 2-heteroarylbenzal-
dehydes with aromatic amines and diacetyl, followed by double
intramolecular oxidative aromatic coupling. This two-step
procedure aﬀorded the desired products in overall yields of 5−
36%, and it tolerates structural diversity of starting materials.
All the ﬁnal dyes exhibit strong blue ﬂuorescence in solution.

P olycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)1−5 and their

heterocyclic analogues possessing π-expanded struc-
tures6−21 are undergoing a renaissance due to their potential
applications in the ﬁeld of organic electronics, such as organic
light emitting diodes (OLEDs),22,23 organic ﬁeld eﬀect
transistors (OFETs)24,25 as well as dye-sensitized solar cells.26
Particular contributions in this ongoing development have
ladder-type compounds.9−19 In contrast to linear heteroacenes,
which have been investigated for a long time,27,28 ladder-type
heterocycles became widely studied rather recently.29−34 A vast
majority of known heteroacenes belonging to heteropentalenes
family are built on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, as well as on
thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole cores.35−40 In contrast, 1,4-dihydro-
pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrroles (DHPP) are much less investigated.41,42
Very recently novel methodologies
the synthesis of
tetraaryl-pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrroles (TAPP)43,44 and indolo[3,2-
b]indoles were discovered.45,46 Herein we would like to present
a straightforward and eﬃcient methodology for the synthesis of
χ-shaped π-expanded 1,4-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrroles togeth-
er with their photophysical properties.

Oxidative aromatic coupling has a potential

to furnish
unprecedented polycyclic aromatic compounds.47 Conditioning
that reacting positions possess reasonable electron-density,
>100 C−C bonds can be formed at once.48 We reasoned that
intrinsically electron-excessive positions 3 and 6 of 1,4-
dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrrole core oﬀer an ideal, electron-rich
reacting site. To prove this hypothesis, reaction of commercially
available biphenyl-2-carboxaldehyde (1a) with 4-tert-butylani-
line (2a) and diacetyl (3) in the presence of catalytic amount of
TsOH aﬀorded the desired product 4a in 48% yield (Table 1),
which was subjected to intramolecular oxidative aromatic
coupling.49 The use of the classical one-electron oxidant, i.e.,
iron(III) chloride, smoothly gave π-expanded DHPP 5a in 75%
yield. Its structure was conﬁrmed by X-ray crystallography
(Figure 1).

It is noteworthy that the molecular structure of polycyclic
ring system of compound 5a is slightly tilted from planarity at
phenathrene moieties, owing to the reasons, which are unclear
at the moment (Figure 1).
<para sub="scope">
Once the synthetic protocol was established, we were able to
synthesize the library of π-expanded pyrrole[3,2-b]pyrroles 5a−
g. To obtain series of 2-aryl and 2-heteroarylbenzaldehydes
1b−f as well as 3-phenylthiophene-2-carboxaldehyde (1g) we
employed two methodologies namely Suzuki coupling50 and
direct arylation reaction.51 Aldehydes 1b, 1c, 1f and 1g were
synthesized via Suzuki coupling utilizing either 2-bromo-4-
cyanobenzaldehyde, 2-bromobenzaldehyde with corresponding
boronic acid, or 2-formylphenylboronic acid with correspond-
ing bromide. Compound 1g was obtained from 3-bromothio-
phene-2-carbaldehyde. Aldehydes 1d and 1e were synthesized
employing direct arylation protocol utilizing 2-bromobenzalde-
hyde (see Experimental Section). Having these starting
materials,
the set of 1,4-dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrroles was
obtained in yields up to 48% (Table 1). In diﬀerent example
heterocyclic aldehyde 1g undergoes the reaction of formation
TAPP, however in much lower yield (only 10%) (Scheme 1).
These compounds were subsequently transformed into π-
expanded DHPPs via oxidative aromatic coupling reaction
mediated by iron(III) chloride in nitromethane. We were
delighted to ﬁnd that in all cases oxidation smoothly aﬀorded
desired products in yields ranging from 45 to 80%. 4-tert-
Butylaniline (2a) was chosen as the building block imparting
reasonable solubility. Bulky t-butyl groups
should have
prevented from π-stacking observed in a large planar aromatic
systems, which is responsible for decreasing their solubility. It
turned out that in two cases solubility of ﬁnal product was so

appreciable improvement of solubility, and we were able to

The optical properties of both parent TAPPs and their π-
expanded analogues was subsequently investigated (Table 2,
Figures 2 and 3). All examined TAPPs possessed absorption
bands, which were typically located between 350 and 400 nm,
in agreement with data reported earlier.43,44 All
investigated
TAPPs have maximum emission in the range from 439 to 524
nm, which corresponds
to blue, cyan and green light.
Intriguingly, dyes 4e and 4f which could be considered as
signiﬁcantly regarding their emission
regioisomers, diﬀer
spectra (Figure 2). Compound 4e emits green light (λ
max =
524 nm), while 4f emits blue light (λ
max = 439 nm). This is
related to the diﬀerence in the excited state geometry of both
compounds. Smaller steric hindrance in dye 4e allows for

planarization of
the molecule in the excited state, which
translates to emission at longer wavelength. Generally TAPPs

synthesized π-expanded DHPPs are blue emitters (λ
460 nm). For dyes 5a−g hypsochromic shift of the emission
(17−88 nm) were observed compared to their parent TAPPs
(Table 2). This is very unusual phenomenon since in all known
analogous cases, forming C−C bonds and planarization of the
molecule caused bathochromic shift of emission.53,54 Indeed, in
some cases the bathochromic shift of ﬂuorescence resulting
from closing two aromatic rings via oxidative aromatic coupling
was ∼100 nm.53 The origin of this unexpected phenomenon
lies probably in the fact that the dihedral angle between main
is close to 90° in
chromophore and N-aryl substituent
compound 5a (Figure 1), while in various 1,2-diarylindoles it
is in the range 67−72°.55−57 Detailed studies performed by
Rettig and co-workers for sterically hindered and unhindered
N-arylpyrroles clearly shown that absorption for the latter ones
(where dihedral angle has to be larger in the ground state) is
strongly hypsochromically shifted versus N-phenylpyrrole.58
We think that analogous phenomenon occurs in our case of
which results in miniscule bathochromic shift of absorption of
5a−f versus 4a−f (Table 2). The same steric hindrance also
decreases the possibility for planarization in the excited state,
hence emission of 5a−f
is hypsochromically shifted. Fluo-
rescence quantum yields of π-expanded DHPPs decreased
signiﬁcantly in comparison to their parent TAPPs, except for
compounds 5g for which this value increased (Φ
fl = 62%
compared to 4g Φ
fl = 23%) and 5f for which Φ
fl negligibly
increased (Φ
fl = 23%). Diﬀerent
structural features of compounds 4g and 5g versus remaining
dyes 4a−f and 5a−f (i.e., the presence of two thiophene
moieties instead of two benzene rings, at peripheral positions)
are plausible rationale behind this phenomenon.

In conclusion, intramolecular oxidative aromatic coupling of
electron-rich dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrroles proved to be an
eﬃcient strategy for assembling χ-shaped π-expanded systems60
possessing up to 12 conjugated rings.61 The approach
presented here is general and thus can be used to prepare
even larger structures and to install diﬀerent functional groups
on the periphery of such π-expanded dyes. The analysis of the
absorption and emission spectra of dihydropyrrolo[3,2-b]-
pyrroles and π-expanded analogues revealed that planarization
of
the structures caused rather unusual changes such as
hypsochromic shift of emission and decrease in ﬂuorescence
quantum yield.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Remarks. All reagents and solvents were purchased from
commercial sources and were used as received unless otherwise noted.
Reagent grade solvents (CH2Cl2, hexanes) were distilled prior to use.
DMF was dried over magnesium sulfate and then distilled and stored
under argon. Transformations with moisture and oxygen sensitive
compounds were performed under a stream of argon. The reaction
progress was monitored by means of thin layer chromatography
(TLC), which was performed on aluminum foil plates, covered with
Silica gel 60 F254 or Aluminum oxide 60 F254 (neutral). Products
puriﬁcation was done by means of column chromatography with
Kieselgel 60 or Aluminum oxide. Occasionally, dry column vacuum
chromatography (DCVC) for puriﬁcation of products obtained was
performed using Silica gel Type D 5F. The identity and purity of
prepared compounds were proved by 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectrometry as well as by MS-spectrometry (via EI-MS or ESI-MS).
For HRMS measurements both quadruple and TOF mass analyzer
types were used. NMR spectra were measured on 500 MHz, 600 or
400 MHz instruments with TMS as internal standard. All chemical
shifts are given in ppm. All melting points for crystalline products were
measured with automated melting point apparatus and were given
without correction. The absorbance and ﬂuorescence spectra were
measured in dichloromethane.
Linear Optical Measurements. Steady-state ﬂuorescence meas-
urements were performed with dilute solutions (10−6 M, optical
density <0.1) contained in standard 1 cm quartz cuvettes at room
temperature. Compounds were dissolved in dichloromethane unless
otherwise noted. Emission spectra were obtained, for each compound,
under excitation at λ = 350 nm. Fluorescence quantum yields were
measured by using quinine hemisulfate monohydrate in 0.5m sulfuric
acid as a standard.
Electrochemistry. The cyclic voltammograms of compounds 5a−
5d and 5f−5g were measured at 20 °C, under argon atmosphere, in
deoxygenated 0.1 M solutions of
tetrabutylammonium hexaﬂuor-
ophosphate in anhydrous dichloromethane. Glassy carbon working
electrode, Ag/AgCl reference electrode and auxiliary platinum foil
were used, while the scan rate for presented voltammograms was v =
50 mVs−1. All reported values of E [V] are in respect to Fc+/Fc redox
potential.
the second oxidation process remains
irreversible irrespective of the value of v (50−1000 mVs−1). For 5f,
voltammetric curves recorded at v = 50 mVs−1, reveal two anodic
peaks located at Ea = 0.39 and 0.88 V, followed by two overlapping
cathodic peaks with a visible current maximum at 0.35 V. At higher
scan rates, cathodic peaks resolve and both of the values of E1/2
ox could
be determined.

ﬂask equipped with magnetic stir bar and septum, 12 mL of dry
methylene chloride and 1 mmol of adequate TAPP were placed. To
dissolved substrate, 20 mmol of ferric chloride dissolved in 12 mL of
dry nitromethane were added via syringe. Reaction was conducted at
room temperature for 30 min. Then 15 mL of water was added, and
resulting mixture was stirred for another 15 min. Two phases were
separated, water phase was extracted with methylene chloride (3 × 10
mL). Organic phases were combined and dried,
solvent was
evaporated and crude product was puriﬁed by means of ﬂash column
