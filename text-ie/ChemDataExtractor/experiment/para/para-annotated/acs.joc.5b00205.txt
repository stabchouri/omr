ABSTRACT: 2-Substituted N-acyl-piperidine is a widespread and important structural
motif, found in approximately 500 currently available structures, and present in nearly
30 pharmaceutically active compounds. Restricted rotation of the acyl substituent in
such molecules can give rise to two distinct chemical environments. Here we
demonstrate, using NMR studies and density functional theory modeling of the lowest
energy structures of 5-acyl-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine derivatives, that the amide
E:Z equilibrium is aﬀected by non-covalent interactions between the amide oxygen and
adjacent aromatic protons. Structural predictions were used to design molecules that promote either the E- or Z-amide
conformation, enabling preparation of compounds with a tailored conformational ratio, as proven by NMR studies. Analysis of
the available X-ray data of a variety of published N-acyl-piperidine-containing compounds further indicates that these molecules
are also clustered in the two observed conformations. This ﬁnding emphasizes that directed conformational isomerism has
signiﬁcant implications for the design of both small molecules and larger amide-containing molecular architectures.

■ INTRODUCTION

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The 2-substituted N-acyl-piperidine motif is present in a wide
range of molecular architectures,1 including those of bio-
logically active compounds.2 Restricted rotation about
the
amide bond aﬀects the chemical space sampled by the acyl
substituent and can therefore have an impact on molecular
properties; the pharmacological inﬂuence of restricted rotation
and atropisomerism is
increasingly recognized in drug
discovery.3 This emerging challenge necessitates tools to
analyze and manipulate the conformation of target compounds.
5-Acyl-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridines are a known class of
inhibitors of
the protein Hedgehog acyltransferase, a key
regulator of embryonic neurogenesis and carcinogenesis.4 This
class of compounds contains a core 2-substituted N-acyl-
piperidine motif and exhibits an unequal distribution of
rotameric species. Low-temperature selective NOE assignment
of rotamers,
in combination with density functional theory
(DFT) modeling,
indicated the existence of a non-covalent
interaction (NCI) between the ortho position of a 2-phenyl N-
acyl-piperidine and the amide carbonyl, altering the amide
conformation. These tools were therefore used for de novo
design and analysis of 5-acyl-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridines
with manipulated conformational preferences. Analysis of N-
acyl-piperidine-containing molecules identiﬁed an approxi-
mately equal distribution of rotamers in non-lactam compounds
that contain a rotatable amide, which would be amenable to
such conformational modulation. Moreover, strategies for
directing conformation are also of interest in larger peptide-
and peptoid-based architectures.

Compound 1 was synthesized from thiophene ethylamine by a
previously reported synthetic strategy5 with microwave
assistance to promote Bischler−Napieralski cyclization (Figure
1).6

The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 shows the presence of several
additional hydrogen environments (Figure 2A). The most
prominently shifted of these proton signals are a singlet and a
multiplet at 5.92 and 4.86 ppm,
respectively, which are
separated from other hydrogen environments by >1 ppm.
Additional peaks can be observed at 6.69 and 2.28 ppm (Figure
2A). To investigate the signiﬁcance of the amide bond in
generating these additional environments, we synthesized
acrylamide derivative 2, along with the corresponding
decarbonyl derivative 3, through reaction with allyl bromide.
As postulated, the acrylamide derivative exhibits the additional
hydrogen environments, whereas these are absent in the allyl
derivative (Figures S7 and S12), demonstrating the dependence
on the amide carbonyl and implicating restricted rotation about
the N−C bond.

To conﬁrm that the additional peaks observed in the 1H
NMR spectrum corresponded to isomers of 1, we recorded the
NOESY spectra to identify exchangeable proton environments
(Figure S3). NOESY exchange peaks identify the prominently
shifted hydrogen environments at δ = 5.92 and 4.86 ppm as
corresponding to H6 and one H4 proton, respectively. In both
cases, the shifted protons are adjacent to the amide nitrogen.

conﬁrming the minor and major conformations as E and Z,
respectively, in a 22:78 E:Z ratio.
It has been proposed that N-α aromatic amides may form
n−π*
aryl interactions between the lone pair of the carbonyl and
the anti-bonding orbital of the adjacent aromatic ring.8 In such
cases, changes in the electronics of the ring system8,9 or the
nature of the lone pair donor have been used to modulate
n−π* interactions.10,11 In order to probe putative n−π*

system,
the phenyl ring was replaced with a cyclohexane
moiety in compound 4 using the established synthetic route.
218 K NOESY of 4 (Figure S17) and selective NOE irradiation
of the methyl peaks (Figures S18 and S19) indicate a signiﬁcant
increase in the proportion of the E-amide conformation, giving
an E:Z ratio of 57:43 (Table S6).

The cyclohexane ring of 4 causes a minimal increase in steric
encumbrance compared to 3, suggesting that
the altered
conformational preference resulted from electronic factors.12
This promotion of the Z-conformer, however, could not be
deﬁnitively ascribed to the absence of the π* orbital and a loss
of a putative n−π*
aryl interaction. We therefore proceeded to
increase the lone pair donor capability in the molecule by
exchanging the carbonyl oxygen with sulfur.11 The latter should
exhibit increased n−π*
aryl donation and thereby result in a
the Z-amide.11 Thioamide 5 was

synthesized by thionation of 1 with Lawesson’s reagent, and
the conformations were assigned using low-temperature
NOESY and selective NOE experiments (Figures S24 and
S25). Analysis indicates an E:Z ratio similar to that of the
parent amide 1 (Figure S1), thus indicating that n−π*
aryl
interactions are unlikely to modulate the amide conformation
in this system.

proposed to direct amide conformation in N-α aromatic
peptoids,12 natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of compound
1 did not identify any substantial bonding interactions, and did
not prove to be discriminatory enough to detect the weaker

better suited for the investigation of through-bond eﬀects rather

methyl environments at 2.19 (black) and 2.35 (red) ppm at 218 K
demonstrates the major Z-conformer. All NMR spectra were recorded
in CDCl3.

The two peaks presented by the acetyl methyl group also
exhibit exchangeable hydrogen environments, and the addi-
tional environment at 6.79 ppm corresponds to the H8 proton
of the thiophene ring. In order to assign E- and Z-amide
conformations to the major and minor proton environments,
we performed selective NOE experiments by pulsing at 2.19 or
2.35 ppm. At 298 K, signiﬁcant crosstalk is observed between
environments due to amide rotation (data not shown). We
therefore performed low-temperature NMR experiments to
limit rotation on the NMR time scale.7 The corresponding
NOESY spectra at 218 K indicate the loss of exchange between
the proton peaks (Figure S4). Selective irradiation of the major
methyl environment at 2.19 ppm generates an NOE at
piperidine H4 (Figure 2B). Similarly, irradiation at 2.35 ppm

the stereoselectivity is controlled by a

tions that are inﬂuenced by NCIs within the molecular
architecture. The balance of these interactions can be diﬃcult

We therefore applied DFT modeling and NCI analysis
(ωB97XD/TZVP/SCRF = chloroform)15 to compare small
energy diﬀerences between structures and the corresponding
populations of compounds 1 and 4 (Figure 3). This model
predicts that the amide lone pair in the Z-conﬁguration is not in
the correct orientation to participate in an n−π*
aryl interaction.
Compound 1 exhibits four potential conformations, corre-
sponding to two potential amide rotamers and the two
piperidine ring-ﬂipped conformations (cf. Web-enhanced
table). Comparison of the relative energy of these conforma-
tions of 1 reveals that the Z-amide isomer is lower in free
energy than the E-amide (Table S1). The Boltzmann
population distribution of the four energy minima indicates
only signiﬁcant population of
the E- and Z-ground-state
conformers in a 16:84 E:Z ratio,
in good agreement with
observed values (Tables S1 and S2). Prediction of the 1H NMR
chemical shifts for Z-1 provided resonances of the acetyl methyl
protons at an average value of 2.01 ppm and for the equatorial
H4 proton at 3.57 ppm, in good agreement with NOE results
(Table S3, Figure 2B). The predicted shifts for E-1 gave the
methyl protons at an averaged resonance of 2.36 ppm and H6
at 6.09 ppm, also in excellent agreement with experimental data
(Table S4, Figure 2B).

forms of

To understand the interactions inﬂuencing the energetic
stability of each rotamer of 1, NCI
for each
conformation were inspected (Figure 3A).13,14,16 In the lowest
energy (Z)-amide conformation, the amide carbonyl group
forms a stabilizing NCI with the piperidine H6 proton and the
ortho aromatic proton. Additional
favorable interactions are
found in both conformers between the thiophene ring and the
ortho proton of the phenyl ring, as well as between the phenyl
ring and the axial H4 proton of the piperidine ring. Compound
4 exhibits eight potential conformations, corresponding to
combinations of two potential amide rotamers, two piperidine
ring-ﬂipped conformations, and two chair
the
cyclohexyl ring (cf. Web-enhanced table). The NCI surfaces
of the lowest energy conformations of 4 (Table S5) indicate
that the Z-conformation no longer beneﬁts from favorable
interaction with the ortho position of
the cyclohexyl ring
(Figure 3B). Correspondingly, the lowest energy E- and Z-
conformations are energetically equal, with the next highest
energy levels corresponding to rotation about
the C6-
cyclohexyl bond. The calculated energy levels did not indicate
any prominent interactions favoring E- or Z-conformers (Table
S5),
in good agreement with the observed 57:43 E:Z ratio.
Weighting the predicted 1H NMR chemical shifts for each E-
and Z-energy level against the predicted Boltzmann population
gives an average chemical shift prediction. The calculated
average resonance for the Z-4 acetyl methyl protons is 2.03
ppm (Table S7, Figure S14); low-temperature selective NOE
experiments irradiating at the piperidine H4 resonances give an
NOE at 2.14 ppm (Table S8, Figure S19).

With robust systems in place to predict and measure amide
conformations, molecules were designed to promote either the
E- or Z-conformer. Replacing the ortho CH of the phenyl
moiety of 1 with 2-pyridyl derivative 6 was envisaged to
promote the E-conﬁguration by reversing the electrostatic
interactions. Compound 6 exhibits eight potential conforma-
tions, corresponding to combinations of two amide rotamers,
two piperidine ring-ﬂipped conformations, and two rotated

conformations about the C6-pyridine bond (cf. Web-enhanced
table). The NCI surface prediction for 6 indicates that the
nitrogen atom induces electrostatic repulsion with the carbonyl
oxygen in the Z-conformer (Figure 3C), resulting in no
predicted preference for the E- or Z-conformer within the
accuracy of the calculations. Compound 6 was synthesized from
2-picolinic acid using the established synthetic route, and the
conformation was assigned using the described approach
combining weighted 1H NMR prediction (Tables S11 and
S12),
low-temperature NOESY, and selective NOE experi-
ments (Figures S29 and S30). As predicted, 6 exhibits an
increased propensity for
the E-conformer compared to
compound 1, with an E:Z ratio of 48:52, in good agreement
with the predicted absence of Z-conformational preference.
Additionally, 1H NMR spectra of compounds 4 and 6 were
recorded from 297 to 378 K and from 308 to 408 K which gave
coalescence temperatures of 368 and 358 K, approximately
corresponding to ΔG⧧ values of 18.9 and 18.4 kcal/mol,
respectively (section 2.16 in the Supporting Information). Both
free activation energies are typical
for hindered internal
rotations in N,N-dialkylamides.17

two amide rotamers,

Increasing the strength of

the interaction between the
carbonyl group and the aromatic ring should promote the Z-
conformation.18 A hydroxyl group was therefore inserted at the
phenyl ortho position, which was predicted to be in correct
alignment to hydrogen-bond with the carbonyl with a CO−HO
bond distance of 1.71 Å and a 6° deviation from linearity in the
CO−HO bond (Figure 3D).19 Indeed, NBO analysis of the
ground state of the ortho-hydroxy derivative indicated strong
bonding interactions between both carbonyl oxygen lone pairs
and the hydroxyl σ* (16.7 and 6.5 kcal/mol for σ-character and
π-character lone pairs, respectively) (cf. Web-enhanced table).
Compound 8 exhibits eight potential conformations, corre-
sponding to combinations of
two
piperidine ring-ﬂipped conformations, and two rotated
conformations about the C6−phenol bond (cf. Web-enhanced
table). DFT analysis of the energy levels of these conformations
predicted that the three lowest energy conformers exhibit the
Z-conformation. The lowest energy E-conformer was less
favored by 5.1 kcal/mol, equating to a relative population
distribution of ∼5000:1. The required molecule was synthe-
sized from 2-methoxybenzoic acid, initially aﬀording 2-methoxy
derivative 7. Low-temperature NOESY and NOE spectra
indicate that 7 preferentially adopted the E-conformation,
with and E:Z of 80:20, providing a more eﬀective means to
repel the amide carbonyl into the E-conformation. Demethy-
lation of 7 with tribromoborane furnished the required phenol
8 (Figure 1). 1H NMR spectra of 8 recorded in CDCl3 indicate
that, as predicted, only a single amide conformation is observed
(Table 1, Figure S37). NOESY spectroscopy and selective

NOE pulsed at the methyl environment at 2.23 ppm, both at
room temperature, were used to conﬁrm the exclusive presence
the intended Z-conformation (Figures S39−S41). The
of
existence of the proposed hydrogen bond between the carbonyl
and hydroxyl groups was supported by good agreement
between the predicted and observed chemical shifts at 9.94
and 9.83 ppm, respectively. DFT prediction of the 1H chemical
shift has been applied to a crystallographically validated
hydrogen-bonded proton, similarly demonstrating good agree-
ment between predicted and observed values.20 In order to
conﬁrm the presence of the putative hydrogen bond, the solid-
state IR spectrum of 8 was recorded (Figure S43). This

intramolecular hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl group.21 The
lower hydroxyl vibrational
frequency observed was also in
agreement with DFT calculation of the lowered harmonic
oscillation of the hydroxyl group of 8 (Figure S43). The 1H
NMR spectra of 8 recorded in DMSO-d6 resulted in an E:Z
ratio of 40:60 (Figure S42). As a polar aprotic solvent, DMSO
acts as a potent hydrogen-bond acceptor, thereby disrupting the
internal hydrogen bond of 8. Attempts to assess the eﬀect of
polar protic solvents (D2O, MeOD) on the hydrogen-bonding
and conformational ratio of 8 were unsuccessful due to poor
1H NMR analysis of 8
solubility. Mixed-solvent D2O:DMSO-d6
maintained a 40:60 E:Z ratio up to 30% D2O, above which D2O
concentration 8 precipitated. Investigation of the conformation
properties of more water-soluble 5-acyl-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-
c]pyridine derivatives in polar protic solvents is therefore
continuing in our laboratory.

■ CONCLUSION

The 2-substituted N-acyl-piperidine motif can be found in a
range of known molecular architectures and biologically active
compounds. Further analysis of the 474 2-substituted N-acyl-
piperidine-containing structures available in the Cambridge
Crystallographic Database identiﬁes a subset of 186 amides in
which an acyclic amide bond is present. Evaluation of the
the C−N−C−O bond in these hits
torsion angle about
indicates a clustering of the compounds in approximately equal
population for the E- and Z-conformers at 0° and 180°,
respectively (Figure S74).1 These 186 compounds should be
amenable to predictive and designed conformational modu-
lation using the approach presented here. Remarkably, the ortho
phenol 2-substituted N-acyl-piperidine motif of compound 8
represents a currently unreported molecular architecture. We
speculate that predictable modulation of the amide conforma-
tion in this class of molecules may additionally be used to
promote target binding of bioactive molecules by biasing
toward the correct binding conformation. Of the 29 bioactive
compounds in the DrugBank database containing the core
motif, including 13 approved and 3 investigational drugs, 20
have rotatable amide substituents.2 Strategies to lock molecules
in the correct binding conformation commonly involve
rigidifying the molecule through the insertion of a ring system;
however, this often results in decreased solubility, through
increased lattice energy and predominantly increased logP.22
The use of heteroatom insertion presented here may be seen as
an alternative to cyclization to promote the required amide
conformation without concomitant increase in clogP (Table
S15). Ongoing research in our
laboratory is focused on
assessing the eﬀect of conformational modulation on the
biological activity of
the 5-acyl-6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]-
pyridines.

The computational

studies presented here provide a
powerful tool for the design and analysis of molecules with
required conformations. NCI analysis is a superior method
compared to NBO analysis
for determining low-energy,
through-space interactions that may have profound implications
on the conformational properties of molecules. The combina-
tion of chemical shift predictions for conformers with weighting
from the Boltzmann population distribution of the calculated
energy levels provides an accurate method for predicting NMR
signals of each conformer. Calculated NMR shifts predom-
inantly show <0.3 ppm deviation from observed values, with
the exception of
the six-membered aromatic ring protons
(Tables S3, S4, S7, S8, S11, S12, and S14). NCI surface
visualization provides a simple visual model for the analysis of
detailed intramolecular
impact on the
conformation, and we envisage that this approach will be
adopted as a facile tool to aid synthetic chemists in the design
and understanding of molecules.15

that

In summary, we have identiﬁed amide bond rotamers in 2-
substituted N-acyl-piperidines, assigned their conformations
through a combination of NOE experiments at low temperature
to limit amide rotation, and established a predictive structural
model that enabled design of molecules with programmed
changes in conformational preference. Taken together, the de
novo design and heteroatom insertions presented here provide a
powerful method for modulation of amide conformation
through either attractive hydrogen-bonding or
repulsive
electronic interactions.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

Microwave reactions were performed using a Biotage Initiator. 1H
NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature at
500 and 125 MHz, or 400 and 100 MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts
(δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to residual solvent
peaks as internal standard. Coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz
(Hz). The peaks corresponding to the conformers are labeled with E
or Z, respectively. Selective NOE and 2D-NOESY spectra were
recorded at 400 and 500 MHz at room temperature or 221 and 218 K,
respectively. High-temperature 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 500
MHz in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 from 308 to 408 K in steps of 10
K. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was performed using
electrospray ionization (ESI) and time-of-ﬂight (TOF) mass analysis.

General Procedure A: Thiophene Ethylamide Preparation
Using (Benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium Hexa-
ﬂuorophosphate (PyBOP). 2-(3-Thienyl)ethylamine (0.5 mL, 543
mg, 4.3 mmol, 1 equiv) was added to a solution of the corresponding
carboxylic acid (4.73 mmol, 1.1 equiv), PyBOP (2.45 g, 4.73 mmol, 1.1
equiv), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA, 2.3 mL, 1.67 g, 12.9
mmol, 3 equiv) in DMF (2 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt
overnight. Afterward, DCM (30 mL) was added, and the solution was
washed with an aqueous solution of LiCl (5% m/m) and brine to
remove excess DMF. The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, the
solvent was removed in vacuum, and the residual was puriﬁed by
column chromatography.

General Procedure B: Thiophene Ethylamide Preparation
Using Acid Chlorides. Thiophene ethylamine (0.5 mL, 543 mg, 4.3
mmol, 1 equiv) was added dropwise (exothermic reaction) to a
solution of the corresponding carboxylic acid chloride (5.16 mmol, 1.2
equiv) and triethylamine (TEA, 1.2 mL, 870 mg, 2 equiv) in dry DCM
(5 mL). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt overnight. Afterward,
the solvent was removed in vacuum, and the residual was puriﬁed by
column chromatography.

Microwave Conditions. The acylated thiophene ethylamine
derivative (0.38 mmol, 1 equiv) and POCl3 (0.35 mL, 578 mg, 3.8

mmol, 10 equiv) were added to a suspension of P2O5 (160 mg, 1.14
mmol, 3 equiv) in dry toluene (2 mL). The mixture was heated by
microwave irradiation at 140 °C for 0.5 h. The temperature was
gradually increased. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was basiﬁed
(pH = 10) using an aqueous solution of NaOH (20% v/v). The
organic phase was separated and dried over MgSO4, the solvent was
removed in vacuum, and the residual was puriﬁed by column
chromatography.
General Procedure D: Bischler−Napieralski Reaction under
Reﬂux Conditions. A mixture of the acylated thiophene ethylamine
derivative (0.84 mmol, 1 equiv), POCl3 (0.23 mL, 388 mg, 2.53 mmol,
3 equiv), and P2O5 (359 mg, 2.53 mmol, 3 equiv) dissolved in xylene
(3 mL) was heated at 85 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the reaction
mixture was basiﬁed (pH = 10) using an aqueous solution of NaOH
(20% v/v). The organic phase was diluted with toluene, separated, and
dried over MgSO4, and the solvent was removed in vacuum. The cyclic
imine was used without further puriﬁcation.
General Procedure E: Reduction of the Imine. The cyclic
imine obtained from general procedure C (12b−15b) or 7-cyclohexyl-
6,7-dihydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridine (16b) (0.41 mmol, 1 equiv) was
dissolved in dry methanol (1.6 mL). NaBH4 (23 mg, 0.62 mmol, 1.5
equiv) was added to the solution in small portions, and the reaction
mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h or overnight. Afterward, the mixture
was concentrated in vacuum, and the residual was redissolved in H2O
(1 mL) and extracted using DCM. The organic phase was dried over
MgSO4 and the solvent removed in vacuum. The amine was used
without further puriﬁcation.

General Procedure F: Coupling of the Side Chain Using Acid
Chlorides. The amine obtained from general procedure E (0.09
mmol, 1 equiv) and TEA (0.025 mL, 18 mg, 0.18 mmol, 2 equiv) were
dissolved in dry DCM (1 mL). Subsequently, the corresponding acid
chloride (0.11 mmol, 1.2 equiv) was added, and the reaction mixture
was stirred at rt for 2 h. Afterward the solvent was removed in vacuum,
and the residual was puriﬁed by column chromatography.

N-[2-(2-Thienyl)ethyl]benzamide (9a). The amide 9a was
obtained from 2-(3-thienyl)ethylamine (0.50 mL, 543 mg, 4.3 mmol,
