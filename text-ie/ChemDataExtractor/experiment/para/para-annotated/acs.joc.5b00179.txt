ABSTRACT: A concise and eﬃcacious one-pot protocol for the synthesis of novel glycosyl-β-azido ester 3 from glycosyl oleﬁnic
ester 1 under mild conditions has been devised. The β-aminoester, formed by the conjugate addition of ammonia on oleﬁnic
ester, undergoes a metal-catalyzed diazotransfer reaction to furnish glycosyl-β-azido ester. The optimized conditions for
diazotransfer reaction indicate that imidazole-1-sulphonyl azide and K2CO3 give the best results in the presence of ZnCl2. A
diverse range of novel regioselective triazolyl glycoconjugates 6a−u have been achieved in high yields via 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition of compound 3 with various alkynes in the presence of CuI/DIPEA. Structures of all the compounds have been
elucidated using IR, NMR, MS, and elemental analysis, and four of them (3a, 3b, 4b, and 6a) have also been characterized by
single crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis.

1,2,3-Triazoles are one of
important classes of
heterocycles that have been studied over the past decade because
of their wide applicability in material science, biological research,
and medicinal chemistry.1 They possess antitumor,2 anti-HIV,3
cytostatic,4 and antibactericidal properties5 and can also act as
glycosidase6 and GABA inhibitors.7 The triazole moiety, because
of its close electronic and chemical resemblance to an amide
bond, serves as a bioisostere of peptide functionality and hence
plays a major role in the elaboration and composition of
biological systems.8

Carbohydrates and their conjugates play a fundamental role in
normal cell functions, including energy storage, modulation of
protein function, transport, adhesion, signal transduction, as well
as viral and bacterial cell surface recognition. Their role in
biodynamic applications has led to increased demand of
carbohydrate-based molecules for complete chemical, medicinal,
biological, and pharmacological investigations.9 In this context,
sugar derivatives with substituted C-5 amide functionality
possess signiﬁcant bioactivity, such as antitubercular, antiﬁlarial,
and α-glucosidase inhibition.9d,10,11 Thus,
the pursuit of
introducing a triazole ring at the C-5 position of sugar derivatives
is quite relevant and demanding. In this perspective, the Huisgen
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of terminal alkynes and organic azides

(click chemistry) has been extensively used in joining two
distinct building blocks, enabling easy access to regioselective
novel 1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazolyl conjugates of simple to
complex molecular-level architectures.12−14 Although this
chemistry has exponentially expanding applications in various
disciplines of science, ranging from organic synthesis, material
science, and catalysis to chemical biology; however, special
attention has been received in the ﬁeld of glycoscience because it
leads to an easy route for triazolyl glycoconjugation in diverse
applications.13e

The role of azides in the click reaction is well established.15 For
the introduction of a triazole skeleton at the β-position (C-5) of
glycosyl oleﬁnic ester, the presence of an azide group is necessary.
However, the introduction of azide functionality at the β-position
of oleﬁnic esters is still a challenging task. Several established
strategies for the β-azidation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
compounds include conjugate addition of the azide via HN3 in
HOAc, HN3 with Lewis bases, and TMSN3 with HOAc. These
methods suﬀer from some limitations, including poor reaction
yields, requiring elevated temperature (353 K) and long reaction
times.16−18 A search of the available literature revealed that there

is no report on the β-azidation of glycosyl oleﬁnic esters. Our
current interest in azide chemistry, and the need for new and
speciﬁc ﬂexible strategies that would provide potentially useful
routes for triazole synthesis, prompted us to determine a new
methodology for this purpose. In this article, we report a new and
remarkably mild synthesis of novel glycosyl-β-azido ester and its
application for the development of glycosyl-β-triazolyl esters in
good to excellent yields.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
We ﬁrst investigated the conjugate addition of azide to glycosyl
oleﬁnic ester 1 using previously reported reagents and reaction
conditions for β-azidation of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl com-
pounds.16−18 To our surprise, the reaction of compound 1 with
hydrogen azide in acidic media (HOAc)16 using a Lewis base
catalyst (Et3N) at two diﬀerent temperatures (30 and 80 °C),17
TMSN3, HOAc with tertiary amine (Et3N) as catalyst,18a and
NaN3 in dry DMF at 80 °C, indicated the absence of product.
These results indicate that synthesis of glycosyl-β-azido ester was
indeed challenging using these earlier methods. Therefore, a
diﬀerent route was developed for the synthesis of glycosyl-β-
azido ester.

addition of amine on glycosyl oleﬁnic ester followed by a metal-
catalyzed diazotransfer reaction of amine. Expectedly,
the
reaction led to the formation of glycosyl-β-azido ester with
signiﬁcant ease. Our synthetic protocol started from a cheap and
readily available compound, D-glucose, which undergoes a
number of high-yielding steps, such as isopropylidene protection,

followed by NaIO4 oxidation, and ﬁnally Horner−Emmons−

jugate addition of oleﬁnic ester 1 with ammonia in dry ethanol
yielded (1R,2R,3S,4R)-ethyl-[5-amino-3-O-benzyl-5,6-dideoxy-

2a and 2b as a diastereomeric mixture (70:30) in good yield
(Scheme 1).19,20 The diastereoselectivity ratio was determined
by literature precedent.19,20 The major and minor isomers were
successfully isolated in pure form by ﬂash column chromatog-
raphy. The observed diastereoselectivity can be rationalized by
Felkin−Anh-like transition states based on an alkene−arene π
stacking interaction as described by earlier studies.20,21 The
synthesized glycosyl-β-amino ester can undergo a diazotransfer
reaction to form glycosyl-β-azido ester. To achieve an eﬃcient,
practical, and easy synthesis of novel glycosyl-β-azido esters, we
focused on the diazotransfer reaction and related chemistry. The
major isomer 2a was further used for the optimization studies.

imidazole-1-sulphonyl azide22 as the donor of a diazo group in

1). Separation of major and minor isomers was achieved by ﬂash
column chromatography, and the structure was conﬁrmed by
NMR (1H and 13C). Lastly, single crystal X-ray analysis
conﬁrmed the unambiguous structure and stereochemistry at
the C-5 center in compounds 3a and 3b (Figure 1).

The success of this reaction prompted us toward the synthesis

in situ by the reaction of equimolar quantities of sodium azide
and sulfuryl chloride in MeCN, gave indole-3-carboxaldehyde-1-

puriﬁcation by ﬂash column chromatography) as a yellow solid

obtained in excellent yield (86%). This was followed by copper
(80%), and decent results were also observed using nickel over a
5 h duration (Table 3). In a control experiment in which the
metal catalyst was omitted completely, the product was obtained
in low yields,
indicating a decrease in the eﬃciency of the
reaction. The other metals, MgII, CoII, PdII, and CaII, had a
negligible eﬀect with nearly the same reaction yield as that in the
absence of metal catalyst (entries 4−8, Table 3). Os(III) and
Ru(III) also have no eﬀect on the reaction (Cu as sulfate, Zn, Mg,
Co, Ni, Ca, Pd, Os, and Ru as chlorides). These observations
suggest that the metal catalyst might increase the rate of the
reaction by lowering the activation energy barrier for the
reaction. It might also act as a Lewis acid catalyst to activate the
imidazole-1-sulphonyl azide toward the probable reaction via the
nucleophilic mechanism.24

<para sub=“opt”>
Next, the eﬀect of diﬀerent bases was investigated. Upon
scanning the reaction for various inorganic/organic bases, it was
revealed that 2.0 equiv of either bicarbonate or carbonate bases
resulted in comparable product formation as was evident from
the results obtained in Table 4 (entries 1−3). Amine bases do not
aﬀect the reaction to a great extent, and thus, low product yield
was obtained.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
Finally, the reaction was screened for a variety of organic
solvents; the results are summarized in Table 5. It was observed
that the reaction performed well in terms of eﬃciency and had
good yields using ethanol and methanol solvents (entries 1 and 3,
Table 5). However, ethanol proved to be the solvent of choice for
the prescribed diazotransfer reaction because ethyl functionality
of the ester group in glycosyl-β-amino ester is preserved in the
product. Using methanol as the solvent, hydrolysis of the ester
2 (bimolecular base-catalyzed
functional group occurred by a BAC
hydrolysis via acyl oxygen cleavage) mechanism. As a result, the
ethyl group present on the ester functionality was replaced by a
methyl group to aﬀord methyl-[5-azido-3-O-benzyl-5,6-dideoxy-
1,2-O-isopropylidene]-α-D-gluco- and -β-L-ido-heptofuranurnate
(4a,b). The 1H NMR data of compound 4b corresponding to 23
proton resonances and a sharp singlet integrated to 3 proton
resonances appearing at δ 3.63 evidenced the presence of the
methyl group. The molecular ion peak [M + H]+ observed at m/z

the diazotransfer reagent I was tested on glycosyl-β-amino ester

3a matched with that of the major isomer obtained in Scheme 1.

<para sub=“opt”>
We then compared the eﬃciency of conversion of glycosyl-β-
amino ester to glycosyl-β-azido ester in the presence of various
diazotransfer reagents, such as imidazole-1-sulphonyl azide,22

Then, with imidazole-1-sulphonyl azide as the well suited
diazotransfer reagent, we performed the next experiment

was observed that the products were obtained in the same yields

diﬀerent counterions. Thus,

The stereochemistry at the C-5 stereogenic center has been
tentatively predicted on the basis of a precedent set in the
literature and mechanistic grounds.20,21 On the basis of Felkin−
Anh and Cram’s transition states, it can be predicted that the
major attack of nucleophilic ammonia at C-5 in oleﬁnic ester
would take place from the side of
the least bulky group
(hydrogen attached to C-4 of
the Si
diastereoface). Thus, the major reaction product has an S
conﬁguration at C-5, whereas that of the minor one is R (Scheme
4). The diazotransfer reaction does not involve a change in
stereochemistry25 at the carbon (C-5) center, so the conﬁg-
uration at this stereocenter should be the same as that in the
glycosyl-β-amino ester previously established. The 1H NMR
spectra of azide 3a (major isomer) showed J4,5 = 9.9 Hz,

assigned to this isomer. Consequently, for the second isomer
(erythro) isolated as a minor ratio, the R stereochemistry could
easily be established at C-5. Therefore, the diazotransfer reaction
on glycosyl-β-amino ester 2a aﬀords the corresponding glycosyl-
β-azido ester (1R,2R,3S,4R,5S)-ethyl-[5-azido-3-O-benzyl-5,6-
dideoxy-1,2-O-isopropylidene]-β-L-ido-heptofuranurnate 3a.
The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 3a corresponds to 25
protons, and a multiplet at δ 7.35 was observed for ﬁve Ar-H
protons. A doublet at δ 5.87 (J = 3.0 Hz) was identiﬁed for the
anomeric proton. The remaining 14 protons of glycosyl-β-azido
ester appeared in the range of δ 2.26−4.69 along with the six
protons of isopropylidene moiety, which appeared as singlets at δ
1.41 and 1.31. A triplet integrated to 3 proton resonances was
observed at δ 1.27 (J = 6.9 Hz) for the −CH2CH3 group. The IR
spectra showed a sharp absorption band at 2134 cm−1, indicating
the presence of an azide (-N3) group, and 19 carbon resonances
appeared in 13C NMR in addition to the molecular ion peak [M +

conﬁrmed the unambiguous structure of compounds 3a and 3b

Once the synthesis of glycosyl-β-azido ester 3 was achieved in
excellent yields, we next turned our focus toward the application
of this compound for CuAAC click reactions. Such reactions, in
general, require a Cu(I) source directly introduced in the
reaction medium from CuI or by the reduction of Cu(II) salts in
·5H2O or copper acetate in the presence of
form of CuSO4
sodium ascorbate, which is the most frequently used reducing
agent utilized in 3−4 fold excess to give commendable results in
aqueous medium. The latter reagents are more eﬀective because
they maintain a high Cu(I) concentration during the reaction
course, and they are not aﬀected by oxidizing atmosphere. Thus,
we primarily investigated the click reaction between the
developed compound 3a and 1-phenyl-2-propyn-1-ol 5a using
MeOH/H2O, t-BuOH/H2O, CH2Cl2/H2O, Et2O/H2O, THF/
H2O, and acetone/H2O as solvent mixtures. It is easy to verify
that most of
the reactions aﬀorded the corresponding
glycoconjugated triazole 6a using a variety of organic solvents
in combination with H2O (Table 6). However, the optimal yield
of 6a was achieved using a mixture of acetone/H2O (1:1) as the
solvent. A remarkable feature of this reaction is the H2O
dependence of the triazolyl glycoconjugate synthesis (tolerant to
pH range 6−9). Reactions using a mixture of acetone/H2O
(1:0.5) or acetone alone resulted in poor yield of desired product
6a (entries 7 and 8, Table 6). The probable reason is the
dependency toward aqueous media of the in situ generation of
·5H2O and
Cu(I) species from the combination of CuSO4
sodium ascorbate. However, when the reaction was performed

only in H2O, the formation of product 6a was not observed
(entry 9, Table 6) because of the decreased solubility of
compound 3a in aqueous media compared to that in the organic
phase. These observations suggest that in the solvent mixture of
acetone and H2O, the Cu(I) species is generated in situ in
·5H2O and sodium ascorbate and
aqueous medium from CuSO4
then catalyzes the click reaction between compounds 3a and 6a,
which are soluble in the organic phase. It is important to note that
the reactions are not very air sensitive, allowing for preparation of

Mechanistic Consideration. Ammonia adds to oleﬁnic
ester via 1,4 conjugate additions, and its formation can be
rationalized by Felkin−Anh-like transition states based on
alkene-arene π stacking interactions as described in the
literature.19−21 The next step includes the diazotransfer reaction
with imidazole-1-sulphonyl azide. Imidazole-1-sulphonyl azide is
an eﬃcient diazotransfer reagent that has the ability to transfer
the diazo group directly to the primary amine function to form
the corresponding azide.22 The exact mechanism of
the
diazotransfer reaction is to date still controversial; however,
close examination of previous reports for these reactions suggests
that a dianionic tetrazene intermediate is formed during this
reaction and is stabilized by two monovalent metal ions (e.g.,
sodium).27 This proposed mechanism has been further extended
by Nyﬀeler et al. to incorporate a divalent metal ion in place of
the two monovalent ions.28 On the basis of these reports, we
propose a plausible mechanism for the transition metal-catalyzed
diazotransfer reaction of glycosyl-β-azido ester formation. The
mechanism proceeds via the initial complexation of the amine
substrate with the metal catalyst under basic conditions to give 7.
The amine of complex 7 undergoes nucleophilic attack on the
highly electrophilic imidazole-1-sulphonyl azide that, upon
further deprotonation, may possibly form zinc-stabilized mixed
tetrazene 8.29b This zinc-stabilized tetrazene undergoes break-
down possibly by a reverse [3 + 2] dipolar cycloaddition, which
leads to the formation of product glycosyl-β-azido ester and
zinc−imidazole sulphonyl imido complex 9. The computational
work on such similar structures by Brandt et al. suggests that
complex 9 would be in equilibrium with complex 11.29 From
here, two possible pathways could be operating: one leads to
amine complexation followed by consequent proton transfer to
give 9 and the other forms zinc−imido complex 11 via the
transamination of 10. Further, this zinc−imido complex is
employed in a [3 + 2] dipolar cycloaddition with imidazole-1-
sulphonyl azide to alternatively give 8 (Figure 4).

■ CONCLUSION

In conclusion, we have developed a concise and readily adaptable
novel one-pot protocol for easy access to glycosyl-β-azido ester
from glycosyl oleﬁnic ester under mild reaction conditions. This
method demonstrates high eﬃciency in terms of product yields.
The developed glycosyl-β-azido ester has been utilized for the
development of a diverse range of novel triazolyl glycoconju-
gates. On the basis of the presence of a substituted triazole
moiety incorporating various sugar, aryl, and alkyl side chains in
the glycoconjugates, they might prove to be potent scaﬀolds for
biological and pharmaceutical investigations. The short reaction
period, simple workup, high yield, and mild conditions of this
methodology underscore its signiﬁcance. In addition,
the
generality with respect to substrate scope and facile accessibility
to the starting materials is also highly appealing. Synthesis of a
novel glycosyl-β-azido ester from glycosyl oleﬁnic ester has not
yet been realized for one-pot conditions; thus, this approach
should also be of interest to synthetic chemists. The developed
methodology also performs well in small as well as gram scale
synthesis of glycosyl-β-azido ester, suggesting that it may have
industrial signiﬁcance. Biological screening of the developed
glycosyl-β-triazolyl esters is currently under way.
