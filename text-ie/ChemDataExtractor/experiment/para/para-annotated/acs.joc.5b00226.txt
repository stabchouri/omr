ABSTRACT: A rapid and straightforward synthesis of a novel
series of furo[2,3-d]tropones (or cyclohepta[b]furan-6-ones)
has been developed starting from readily and commercially
available materials. Directed α-lithiation of
furan-3-carbox-
aldehydes and subsequent reaction with a variety of aldehydes
eﬃciently provide,
to 3-formyl-2-
furylcarbinols, which are otherwise only accessible with
diﬃculty. The 3-formyl-2-furylcarbinols are further elaborated
in two steps to the synthesis of furo[2,3-d]tropones in good
yields via sequential bismuth(III)chloride-catalyzed furfuryla-
tion and an unusual base promoted cyclization strategy. Thus,
diverse polysubstituted furotropones and benzofurotropones can be rapidly assembled. This methodology thereby oﬀers a
potential approach for the synthesis of several bioactive natural products containing cyclohepta[b]furan core and also for the
buildup of complex molecular architectures through higher order cycloaddition reactions of tropones. Further, the new
chromophores have been found to possess promising ﬂuorescence properties. Selective ﬂuorogenic sensing behavior of
furotropones toward Fe3+ ions has also been elucidated.

■ INTRODUCTION

from synthetic and theoretical

Among nonbenzenoid aromatics, tropones have been studied in
standpoint.1
great detail
Occurrence of several troponoid natural products possessing
interesting biological activities spurred several studies directed
toward understanding structure activity relationships as well as
their physicochemical properties.2 Tropones traditionally have
been employed in several higher order cycloaddition reactions3
and quite often as synthons in natural product synthesis.4
Among annulated tropone derivatives, aryl-annulated tropones
are well-studied, while heteroaryl-annulated tropones are
mostly unfamiliar.5 A detailed literature review exposes lack
of synthetically ﬂexible methods for the synthesis of heteroaryl-
annulated tropones and also a general understanding about
their physical and biological properties is particularly missing.
Toward this, we have initiated research to establish a short,
eﬃcient and scalable approach for the synthesis of previously
unknown furo[2,3-d]tropones from readily available starting
materials. Known methods for
furo[2,3-
d]tropones are depicted in Scheme 1.6 The key step in El-Borai
and Shaﬁee’s approach (method-1, Scheme 1) for tropones

involved the cyclocondensation of
I and ketones

dicarboxaldehydes
strong basic
conditions.6a,b On the other hand, Takeshita’s Claisen
rearrangement of (E/Z)-4-(3-chloro-2-propenyloxy)tropones
III under thermal conditions furnished furo[2,3-d]tropones
(method-2, Scheme 1).6c Evidently,
these methods are
associated with the drawbacks such as (i) diﬃcult-to-access

the synthesis of

starting compounds, (ii) harsh reaction conditions, (iii) poor
yields, (iv) limited substrate scope (that hinders diversiﬁca-
tion). Herein we describe general synthesis of a variety of furo-
and benzofuro[2,3-d]tropones, study of their physicochemical
properties, and especially their ability in cation sensing.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Synthesis and Characterization of Tropones. A general
approach toward the synthesis of furotropones is depicted in

furancarboxaldehydes of
formyl-2-furylcarbinols B in a single step via regioselective
directed α-lithiation-alkylation strategy published earlier by our
research group.7 Following this strategy, aldehyde functionality
in 3-furancarboxaldehydes A can be masked by treatment with
lithium N-methylpiperazide [LNMP, obtained by the reaction
of N-methylpiperazine (NMP) and n-BuLi]. Chelation
controlled lithiation of the resulting adduct at the C-2 position
with n-BuLi generates 2-lithiofurans in highly selective manner.
Reaction of 2-lithiofurans with aldehydes (or ketones) and
subsequent hydrolysis generates conveniently 3-formyl-2-
furylcarbinols B. Bismuth(III) catalyzed reaction of furylcarbi-
nols B and 1,3-dicarbonyls C generate the tricarbonyls D in
very good yields via intermolecular Friedel−Crafts-type
reaction.8 Base mediated intramolecular aldol condensation of

diketoaldehydes D delivers furotropones E in good to excellent
yields via cyclization of the dienolates F on to the appropriately
positioned aldehyde functionality and subsequent aerobic
oxidative aromatization of G.7 This method thus constitutes a
general, short, eﬃcient and straightforward approach for the
synthesis of cyclohepta[b]furan-6-ones (commonly referred to
as furotropones). Some advantages of furan-based strategies are
the ready availability of starting materials, ease of manipulation

Since the general synthetic approach described in Scheme 2
permits diversity across the aldehydes A and H, and the

annulated tropones exhibited good solubility proﬁles

Tropones possessing both aliphatic and aromatic β-ketone

tropones with β,β′-diketones are of particular interest from
synthesis point of view (Table 1, entries 10−12). This novel
class of tropones can be accessed by the reaction of triketones
such as 2d and 3-formyl-2-furylcarbinols under standard

striking impact of solvents on the UV absorption pattern was
witnessed. Among the solvents screened, a nonpolar solvent
such as toluene at 10 μM concentration exhibited an absorption
maximum at 332 nm (due to n−π* transition) while in a polar
solvent DMSO at the same concentration, 3q displayed an
absorption maximum at 338 nm, essentially indicating a
bathochromic shift (red shift) of about 6 nm. On the other
hand, a hypsochromic shift (blue shift) of about 18 nm was
observed in case of π−π* transitions for furotropone 3q from
toluene to DMSO. Further, UV−vis absorption spectra of few
other di- and triketofurotropones (3b, 3c, 3e, 3g, 3h, 3j, 3k)
were also recorded (see Supporting Information for details).

to their strong
nonpolar character and also possible absence of push−pull

Interesting electronic and spectroscopic properties, along
with the presence of the 1,3- di- and 1,3,5-triketo groups in
unique molecular environment
inspired us to explore the
application of furotropones as ﬂuorescent chemosensors for
cations with the potential to coordinate to these functionalities.
Furotropone 3b was chosen as a model substrate and exposed
to the aqueous solutions of diﬀerent metal salts11 in ethanol.
Almost no change in the ﬂuorescence intensity was observed
when solutions of other metal ions such as Hg2+, Pb2+, Cr2+,
Cd2+, Ag+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Co2+, Fe2+, Ni2+ were tested.
Furotropone 3b was found to exhibit an interesting and highly
selective ﬂuorescent molecular sensing property for Fe3+, Figure

serve as a suitable bidentate ligand for Fe3+ while the fused ring
system could enhance the structural rigidity and change the π-
electron distribution. In other words, the hard cation such as
Fe3+ interacts with the hard oxygen atoms of the carbonyls

interactions are less favored since the hard cations will not

prefer interaction with the soft π-surfaces. Decreasing the metal
ion concentration (up to 10 μM), signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
ﬂuorescence intensity was observed. From this study we have
realized that furotropone 3b (and potentially other analogues)
could function as a probe for the detection of Fe3+ up to 10 μM
concentration.

■ CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have developed a modular approach to rapidly
access functionalized and polysubstituted furotropones and
benzofurotropones starting from readily accessible materials.
The three-step protocol features directed α-alkylation of 3-
furancarboxaldehydes, Bi(III)-mediated furfurylation and an
unusual base-mediated intramolecular aldol condensation
reaction. Mono substituted (C-8) furotropones could be
accessed via in situ alkoxy decarbonylation of furotropone β-
ketoesters, disubstituted (C-7 and 8) furotropones could be
synthesized in a retro-Claisen-aromatization strategy, and
trisubstituted (C-5, 7 and 8) furotropones were conveniently
prepared by means of a base-mediated intramolecular aldol
reaction of 1,3,5-triketones. Moreover, studies directed at
understanding the physicochemical properties of furotropones
yielded interesting results. We have identiﬁed that these new
chromophores, with their unique structural
features, have
potential to be highly sensitive and selective sensors for the
detection of hard cations such as Fe3+, and the detection limit
could be as low as 10 μM. We believe that our results could
provide guidance for the design and synthesis of new tropone-
based polycyclic aromatic heterocycles. Further
synthetic
modiﬁcations of
furotropones for chemosensor applications
are planned.

General Experimental Methods. n-BuLi, 3-methyl benzofuran,
all
the aldehydes, N-methylpiperazine, N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine
hydrochloride and solvents were purchased from commercial sources
and were used without further puriﬁcation. For thin-layer chromatog-
raphy (TLC), silica aluminum foils with a ﬂuorescent indicator (254
nm) were used and compounds were visualized by irradiation with UV
light and/or by treatment with a solution of p-anisaldehyde (23 mL),
concentrated H2SO4 (35 mL), and acetic acid (10 mL) in ethanol (900
mL) followed by heating. Column chromatography was performed
using silica gel 100−200 mesh (approximately 15−20 g per 1 g of the
crude product). Dry THF was obtained by distillation over sodium
and stored over sodium wire. IR spectra were recorded on a FT-IR
system as thin ﬁlms or KBr pellets, as indicated, with ν
max values given
in reciprocal centimeters. Melting points were recorded on a digital
melting point apparatus and were uncorrected. 1H NMR and 13C
NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer.
NMR shifts are reported as delta (δ) units in parts per million (ppm),
and coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz). The following

General Procedure for Step-I, Scheme 2 (Synthesis of 3-
Formyl-2-furylcarbinols Starting from 3-Furancarboxalde-
hyes). To a solution of N-methylpiperazine (NMP, 0.07 mL, 0.66
mmol) in THF (2 mL) at −78 °C was added n-BuLi (2 M in
cyclohexane, 0.33 mL, 0.66 mmol). After 15 min, 3-furaldehyde (50
mg, 0.045 mL, 0.52 mmol) was added, and then the reaction mixture
was stirred for an additional 30 min. A cyclohexane solution of n-BuLi
(0.66 mL, 1.32 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred for an
additional 15 min, and then the mixture was warmed to −30 °C in 2 h.
The solution was again cooled to −78 °C and an aldehyde (1.02
mmol) was added dropwise over 5 min. The mixture was warmed to
room temperature over 30 min. The reaction progress was monitored
by TLC. Reaction mixture was quenched with saturated aq.
ammonium chloride solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. The
organic extracts were combined, dried (Na2SO4), ﬁltered, and
concentrated. The crude product was puriﬁed by column chromatog-
raphy on silica gel (ethyl acetate−hexanes) to aﬀord 3-formyl-2-
furylcarbinols in 60−80% yields.

General Procedure for Step-II, Scheme 2 (Reaction of 3-
Formyl-2-furylcarbinols with Various 1,3-Dicarbonyls). To a
solution of furfuryl alcohol (0.1 mmol, 1 equiv) in nitromethane (1
mL), were added acetylacetone (0.11 mmol, 1.1 equiv) followed by
BiCl3 (0.02 mmol, 0.2 equiv) at room temperature. The reaction was
stirred at room temperature until
the alcohol was consumed as
monitored by TLC, and the reaction mixture was quenched with
aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (1−2 mL). The
reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (1−2 mL), and the
layers were separated. The aqueous layer was further extracted with
ethyl acetate (1−2 mL). The organic layers were combined, dried over
Na2SO4, concentrated, and puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatog-
raphy (ethyl acetate−hexanes) to aﬀord 1,3-dicarbonyl adducts in 60−
95% yields.

General Procedure for Step-III, Scheme 2 (Base Mediated
Intramolecular Aldol Condensation of the 1,3-Dicarbonyl
Adducts for the Synthesis of Furotropones). To a solution of
the 1,3-dicarbonyl adduct (0.06 mmol, 1 equiv) in 1 mL DMF, sodium
carbonate (5 mg, 1 equiv) was added under nitrogen atmosphere. The
ﬂask was placed in an oil bath (80 °C) and stirring was continued for 3
h. The reaction mixture was washed with water and extracted with
ethyl acetate. The organic extracts were combined, dried (Na2SO4),
ﬁltered, and concentrated. The crude product was puriﬁed by column
chromatography on silica gel (ethyl acetate−hexanes) to aﬀord
furotropone.
