ABSTRACT: A novel synthesis of imidazoles from electron-
withdrawing group-substituted allenyl
sulfonamides with
amines was developed. The 4- and 5-functionalized imidazoles
were constructed regioselectively, which depended on the
substituents on the nitrogen atoms.

I midazoles are an important class of heterocyclic compounds

that are not only a fundamental motif found in various
natural products but also a key structural unit in pharmaceutical
compounds.1 For example, Olmesartan 1, an angiotensin II
receptor antagonist,2 consists of an imidazole-5-carboxylate unit
Imidazole-4-carboxamide compound 2 was
(Figure 1).

biologically active compounds and pharmaceutical products.

imidazole derivatives that have been reported as

discovered to be a potent and highly selective CB2 receptor
antagonist,3 and imidazolo-nectrisine-phosphono acid deriva-
tive 3 was found to be a potential glycosyltranferase inhibitor.4
Recently,
imidazoles have also been used as precursors to
environmentally friendly ionic solvents5 and carbene ligands.6
Thus, the synthesis of functionalized imidazoles has attracted
considerable attention, and many methods have been
developed for their synthesis.7 However, the reported methods
for their synthesis can be limited with respect to the type and
location of functional group substituents and regioselectivity.
Therefore,
it is still highly desirable to develop direct and
eﬃcient strategies that aﬀord imidazoles derivatives.

Allenamides and ynamides, special classes of functionalized
allenes and alkynes, have recently received much attention in
the synthetic community.8,9 Various nitrogen-containing
building blocks, including nitrogen heterocycles, were success-
fully synthesized from allenamides and ynamides.10,11 Recently,
Rabasso and co-workers reported a simple and eﬃcient
synthesis of α-amino allenephosphonates by the [2,3]-
sigmatropic rearrangement of ynamido-alcohols12 and selective
reduction of amino allenephosphonates for the preparation of
α-amino vinylphosphonates.13 These α-amino allenephospho-
nates represent a kind of allene substituted with both electron-
withdrawing and -donating groups;
they show some
special reactivity. In the continuation of our investigation of
allenamides14 and ynamides,15 we recently found a novel
synthesis of
imidazoles from electron-withdrawing group-
substituted allenyl sulfonamides with amines. Herein, we report
the regioselective synthesis of highly substituted imidazoles.

<para sub=“opt”>
We initiated our studies by examining the reaction of allenyl
sulfonamide 4a with propylamine 5a. Imidazole 6a was not
detected when 4a and 5a were reacted in CH3CN at room
temperature (Table 1, entry 1). Fortunately, in the presence of
a base (K2CO3),
the reaction in reﬂuxing CH3CN gave
imidazole 6a in 39% yield (entry 2). Addition of 2 equiv of 5a
gave a better yield (entry 3). Subsequent screening of solvent
and base showed that DMF proved to be the most suitable
solvent (entries 4−7), whereas K2CO3 was the best base
(entries 8−10). Thus, we concluded that K2CO3 as base in
DMF at 100 °C under air provided the sole product imidazole
6a in the highest yield (87%, entry 5).

amino allenephosphonates and allenephosphine oxides worked
well to aﬀord corresponding imidazol-4-ylphosphonates and
imidazol-4-ylphosphine oxides, respectively. R1 and R2 groups
on the allene moiety could be H, alkyl, and aryl, although bulky
groups resulted in lower yields (entries 9−13). The R3 group of
4 could be a substituted by a phenyl group (entries 1 and 12).
α-Amino allenoates could also undergo this reaction under
modiﬁed conditions (entries 14−17). In all reactions in Table
2, the 4-functionalized imidazole was obtained as the sole
regioisomer, and the structure was revealed by X-ray diﬀraction
of 6c.16
</para>
<para sub="scope">
The reaction of allenyl sulfonamide 4g with BnNH2 5i under
standard conditions aﬀorded the expected imidazole-4-carbox-
ylate 6q. Interestingly, a regioisomer, imidazole-5-carboxylate
7a, was also found (Scheme 1).17 The corresponding
regioisomer was not detected in the 1H NMR spectra of the
crude reaction mixtures when other alkyl amines were
employed (Table 2).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Realizing that the substituents on the nitrogen atoms could
play an important role in the regioselectivity, we conducted
reactions of various amines with allenyl sulfonamides in which
R3 was an alkyl group. As shown in Table 3, N-propyl allenyl
sulfonamides 4i and 4j reacted with substituted benzyl amines
5i−5k to produce imidazole-5-carboxylates 7b−7d and
imidazol-5-ylphosphine oxide 7g. 2-Picolylamine 5l and
allylamine 5m also gave the imidazoles products, albeit in
lower yields (entries 4 and 5). The structure of 7g was revealed
by X-ray diﬀraction.18 In these cases, regioisomers of the 4-
functionalized imidazoles were not detected in the 1H NMR
spectra of the crude reaction mixtures. Thus, this reaction could
regioselectively construct two regioisomers (e.g., 6a and 7g; 6m
and 7b) just by exchanging the substituents on the two
nitrogen atoms. However, the reaction of allenyl sulfonamide 4i
with an alkyl amine, such as n-PrNH2 5a, resulted in an
unidentiﬁed mixture (entry 7), indicating that at least one Bn or
allyl group on the nitrogen atoms was necessary for this
transformation.

<para sub="scope">
To gain more insight

into the reaction mechanism, we
attempted to isolate the intermediate addition product of
allenyl sulfonamides 4g and 4i with amines 5i and 5c (Scheme
2). Without a base, the reaction at room temperature gave the

<para sub="scope">
addition products 8a−8c19 (the structure was revealed by X-ray
diﬀraction of 8a20) in high yield, and no imidazole was found.
Under the standard conditions, 8a−8c were converted to
imidazoles 6 and/or 7. The regioselectivity was consistent with
the results of the one-pot reactions, indicating that 8 was the
intermediate of this sequential reaction.
</para>
<para sub=“ques”>
On the basis of the above experimental observations, the
following plausible mechanism was proposed for this reaction,
as shown in Scheme 3. Initially, the addition reaction of allenyl
sulfonamide 4 with amine 5 aﬀords intermediate A. In the
presence of K2CO3, elimination of one molecule of 4-
methylbenzenesulﬁnic acid21 provides an unstable diimine, B.
Depending on the nature of substitutents at R3 and R5, B could
be further converted to either C or D via a 1,5-H shift followed
by concomitant ring closure.22 Imidazoles 6 or 7 are thus
forged through oxidative aromatization under open air
conditions. Substituents R3 and R5 have extremely important
roles in the product distribution. (i) When either R3 or R5 is an
aryl or vinyl group, a benzylic or allylic proton may facilitate a
1,5-H shift, leading to intermediate C or D, respectively. (ii)
Paths a and b coexist if both R3 and R5 are aryl groups,
generating two sets of
imidazoles. However, due to the
electron-withdrawing eﬀect of the attached ester group, the
proton adjacent to R3 shows stronger acidity, resulting in the
predominance of intermediate C. (iii) In the case that neither
R3 nor R5 is an aryl group, a 1,5-H shift process may be
inhibited without an activated proton; therefore, no imidazole is
produced.
</para>
In conclusion, we have described a novel regioselective
synthesis of highly substituted imidazoles from electron-
withdrawing group-substituted allenyl
sulfonamides with
amines. The imidazol-4- or imidazol-5-ylphosphonates, phos-
phine oxides, and carboxylates were constructed regioselec-
tively, which depended on the substituents on the nitrogen
atoms.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General. All commercially available chemicals and reagents were
used without any further puriﬁcation. NMR spectra were recorded on
a 400 or 500 MHz NMR spectrometer using tetramethylsilane as the
internal standard and CDCl3 as solvent. Chemical shifts are expressed
in ppm, and J values are given in Hz. High-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) was obtained using the ESI− or EI- or APCI-
TOF method. Melting points were measured on a microscopic
apparatus and were uncorrected.

Preparation of the α-amino allenephosphonates and phosphine
oxides was done according to Rabasso’s method.12 Characterization of
unreported α-amino allene phosphine oxide is listed below.

amine 5a (35.5 mg, 0.6 mmol) and K2CO3 (124.4 mg, 0.9 mmol), and
the solution was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and then at 125
°C under air. Upon reaction completion (7 h, TLC, eluent: hexane/
EtOAc 1:1), the mixture was ﬁltered over a plug of silica gel (washed
with 50 mL of EtOAc), and the ﬁltrate was washed with brine, dried
over Na2SO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated. The residue was puriﬁed by
column chromatography on silica gel with hexane/EtOAc (1:1−1:2, v/
v) as the eluent to obtain 6m (51.6 mg, 60%) as a yellow oil. 1H NMR
