ABSTRACT: Stannous chloride catalyzed chemoselective reduc-
tive amination of a variety of carbonyl compounds with aromatic
amines has been developed for the synthesis of a diverse range of
tertiary amines using inexpensive polymethylhydrosiloxane as
reducing agent in methanol. The present method is also applicable
for the synthesis of secondary amines including heterocyclic ones.

T ertiary amines are the most common structural feature of

naturally occurring biologically active alkaloids, industrial
ﬁne chemicals, pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.1 Direct
reductive amination (DRA) of carbonyl compounds is the most
convenient and preferred procedure for the preparation of
amines. However, while DRA was widely used for the synthesis
of secondary amines in which various types of heterogeneous
and homogeneous catalysts have been reported,2−10 few reports
are available for the synthesis of
tertiary amines through
reductive amination. DRA involving aromatic and aliphatic
carbonyl compounds with secondary amines is diﬃcult as the
steric hindrance disfavors the iminium ion/enamine formation
in equilibrium. Also, the in situ transfer hydrogenation of
iminium ion is diﬃcult.

Magid et al. reported sodium triacetoxyborohydride as a
reagent for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds
with diﬀerent aliphatic and aromatic primary and sterically
unhindered aliphatic secondary amines; however, the method
was not applicable to secondary aromatic amines.11 Ishii and
co-workers also developed a method for the alkylation of
secondary aliphatic amines with aldehydes.12 Lee et al.
described the reductive amination of aldehydes and aliphatic
ketones with secondary amines using InCl3 as catalyst with
triethylsilane as reducing agent.6 Recently, Moulin et al.
demonstrated substituted cyclopentadienyl−iron complex
catalyzed reductive amination of aliphatic aldehydes with
secondary amines using H2 as hydrogen source.13 Herein, a
protocol has been developed for DRA of carbonyl compounds
with primary and secondary amines using easily available, water
and air endurance, less corrosive stannous chloride as a catalyst
in the presence of polymethylhydrosiloxane (PMHS) and
methanol. PMHS is a cheap, easy to handle, air and moisture
stable, environment friendly reducing agent, and its byproduct,
polysiliconate, is used in silicon industries as an absorbent.14
Very few reports have shown the use of tin based catalyst for
reductive amination. Xiao group demonstrated reductive
amination using catalytic amount of Bu2SnCl2 in the presence

of phenyl silane15 and Baba et al. also reported Bu2SnClH-
pyridine-N-oxide as a catalyst with diphenylsilane/phenylsilane
as a reducing agent.16 However, these methods were limited for
the synthesis of secondary amines.
<para sub=“opt”>
The present protocol is a versatile method tolerating a variety
including aliphatic and
of carbonyl and amine substrates,
aromatic ketones as well as aldehydes. In our earlier reports, the
role of Lewis acidic character of CoPc and AlCl3 was revealed in
catalyzing the reductive amination reaction.9,10 Although these
methods were very eﬀective in DRA of carbonyl compounds
with primary and secondary amines, unfortunately DRA of
ketones with secondary amines was not eﬀective. In this
context, we focused on the DRA of carbonyl compounds with
secondary amines and screened various Lewis acidic salts. To
optimize the reaction conditions, the reductive amination of
anisaldehyde with N-methylaniline was
investigated with
variation in reaction parameters such as catalyst, reducing
agent, solvent, temperature and time (Table 1). Surprisingly, in
the absence of catalyst, the reaction proceeded to aﬀord the
product in 15% yield (Table 1, entry 1) which was further
lowered in the presence of strong Lewis acids such as AlCl3 and
FeCl3 (Table 1, entries 2−3). While no reaction was observed
with copper, nickel or cobalt based catalysts (Table 1, entries
4−6), zinc chloride showed some activity toward the reaction
(Table 1, entry 7). The best yield of the product was observed
·2H2O and 2 equiv of PMHS as a
with 20 mol % of SnCl2
reducing agent at 70 °C for 6 h in methanol (Table 1, entry 8).
Further, a lower catalyst loading led to lower conversion (Table
1, entry 9), whereas no signiﬁcant change in the yield of the
product was observed with higher catalyst loading (Table 1,
entry 10). The investigation of diﬀerent
reducing agents
the most eﬃcient hydrogen source
revealed PMHS as
providing the product
in 86% yield (Table 1, entry 8).
Comparable yields were recorded with other silanes such as

Lowering the quantity of PMHS resulted in the lower yield of
the desired product (Table 1, entry 15). As expected, no
product was formed in the absence of PMHS; however,
iminium ion was observed as major intermediate (Table 1,
entry 16). Further, diﬀerent
solvents were screened to
investigate the inﬂuence of solvent on the yield as the
interaction of solvent molecules with Lewis acids drastically
inﬂuences catalytic activity and methanol was found to be most
eﬃcient compared to other solvents. Moderate yield of the
product was observed in water and ethanol (Table 1, entries 17
and 18), whereas sterically hindered alcohols such as iPrOH
and nBuOH gave lower yield of the desired product (Table 1,
entries 19−20).
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
In the case of aprotic solvents such as toluene and THF,
moderate yield of the desired product was observed (Table 1,
entries 21 and 22) which further decreased in dry toluene.
Similarly,
in complete anhydrous condition with stannous
chloride in dry methanol, signiﬁcant lowering in the yield was
observed which indicated the supportive role of water in
catalyzing the reaction (Table S1 in the Supporting
Information). A decrease in the yield of the desired product
was observed at lower temperature, while no change in the
yield was observed at 120 °C (Table 1, entries 23 and 24).

<para sub=“ques”>
With the best reaction conditions in hand, the scope and
limitation of SnCl2 catalyzed reductive amination with PMHS
was explored for a variety of carbonyl compounds
in
combination with diﬀerent amines. The reactions condition
was found to be viable to a wide variety of substrate classes
including aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes (Scheme 1).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Halogen substituted aldehydes were well tolerated, and the
corresponding amines were obtained in good to excellent yields
(Scheme 1, 3a−3e). The reductive amination of aldehydes
bearing electron-donating groups with N-methylaniline pro-
ceeded smoothly to aﬀord the desired product in excellent
yields (Scheme 1, 3f−3h). The reaction of polysubstituted
aldehydes with N-methylaniline, a less studied challenging
substrate combination, gave good to excellent yield of the
desired product (Scheme 1, 3i−3l). Sterically hindered
aldehydes provided the desired product in good yield (Scheme
1, 3m−3o). One of the major predicament associated with
reductive amination is intolerance of CC bonds;17 however,
in the present case >99% chemoselectivity was observed with
isolated CC bonds containing
conjugated as well as
aldehydes (Scheme 1, 3p−3s). Reductive amination of 2-
furaldehyde, anthraldehyde, and aliphatic aldehyde,
i.e., 3-
phenylpropionaldehyde, proceeded smoothly to give 3t, 3u,
and 3v in good (70−87%) yield. The reductive amination of
aldehydes with other secondary amines, N-ethylaniline and N-
benzylanisidine, provided an excellent yield of the product
(Scheme 1, 3w−3x). Unfortunately, no reaction was observed
with aliphatic amines under the present reaction condition
(Table S2 in the Supporting Information).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
One of the merits of the present method is the reductive
amination of aromatic and aliphatic ketones with secondary
amines which are otherwise considered diﬃcult substrates for
this reaction resulting in low yields of the product.18 Under the
present reaction conditions, the reductive amination of diﬀerent
aliphatic and aromatic ketones with secondary amines aﬀorded
the desired products in excellent to moderate yields (Scheme
2). Cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone reacted with N-methyl
aniline to aﬀord 5a and 5b in 83 and 90% yields, respectively.
Substituted cyclohexanone also gave excellent yield of the
desired product (Scheme 2, 5c−5d). Reductive amination of 4-
methylcyclohexanone and cyclopentanone with sterically
hindered diphenylamine provided moderate yield of the desired
product (Scheme 2, 5e−5f). In the case of acetophenones,
while no reaction occurred under
reaction
conditions, moderate yield of
the corresponding products
were observed when the reaction was carried out in toluene
with 3 equiv MeOH at 120 °C (Scheme 2, 5g−5i).

Further, the scope of the method was extended for the
reductive animation of carbonyl compounds with primary
amines which aﬀorded excellent yield of the corresponding
secondary amines with high chemoselectivity (Scheme 3).
Excellent yield was observed with electron deﬁcient N-
heteroaromatic primary amines (Scheme 3, 7a−7b). Bogolub-
sky et al. reported an eﬃcient method for the reductive
amination of heterocyclic amines, but the use of NaBH(OAc)3
as a reducing agent which is not eco-friendly and economically
favorable limits its viability.19 Electron donating substituents
present on amines as well as aldehydes were well tolerated and
gave excellent yields of the desired products (Scheme 3, 7c−
7f). One of the major advantages of the present method is the
reductive amination with primary amines bearing electron
withdrawing substituents such as −COOH, −COCH3, and
−NO2 (Scheme 3, 7g−7i) which were otherwise considered as

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General. High grade solvents were used for all reactions. Column
chromatography was carried out with 60−120 mesh silica gel and
monitored with TLC on silica gel 60 F254 plates using UV light as
visualizing agent. 1H NMR and 13C NMR experiments were recorded
on 300 and 600 MHz instruments. Chemical shifts are reported in
parts per million (ppm) downﬁeld from an internal standard. Mass
spectra were recorded on electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-
ﬂight (ESI-QTOF-MS) mass spectrometer. The GC analysis was
carried out on Gas Chromatogram, an AOC-20i autosampler coupled,
and a DB-5MS capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm). The
initial temperature of the column was held at 70 °C for 4 min and was
programmed to 230 °C at 4 °C min−1, then held for 15 min at 230 °C;
the sample injection volume was 1 μL in GC grade dichloromethane.
Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas at a ﬂow rate of 1.1 mL min−1 on
split mode (1:50). UV−vis spectra were recorded on a UV−vis
spectrophotometer.

Typical Procedure for the Reductive Amination. To a stirred
·2H2O (0.2 mmol) in MeOH (3 mL) were added
solution of SnCl2
carbonyl compound (1.1 mmol), amine (1.0 mmol) and PMHS (2.0
H equiv) at room temperature, and then the temperature was raised to
70 °C. After 6 h, the reaction mixture was allowed to cool, ﬁltered and
passed through anhydrous sodium sulfate. The crude product was
puriﬁed by column chromatography over silica gel (60−120 mesh)
with an appropriate mixture of n-hexane and ethyl acetate.
