ABSTRACT: A formal synthesis of
the antiasthma drug
montelukast sodium is described, wherein the key chiral diol
intermediate was accessed with greater convergence of the C−
C bond-forming steps as compared to previous routes.
Improved synthetic eﬃciency was achieved by deploying
homogeneous metal-based catalysis in two pivotal steps. In the
ﬁrst, a tandem Mizoroki−Heck reaction and double-bond
isomerization between a previously known allyl alcohol
intermediate and a hindered 2-(2-halophenyl)propan-2-ol secured direct access to the 3-(2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)phenyl)-1-
phenylpropan-1-one moiety in the product. In the second step, asymmetric hydrogenation of the ketone functionality in the
Mizoroki−Heck reaction product provided a convenient method to introduce the benzylic alcohol chiral center and obtain the
desired chiral diol precursor of montelukast sodium. A detailed catalyst screening led to the identiﬁcation of ((R)-Xyl-
BINAP)((R,R)-DPEN)RuCl2 as a catalyst that aﬀorded an enantioselectivity of 99% ee in the hydrogenation step on a multigram
lab scale at a molar substrate:catalyst loading of 5000:1.

■ INTRODUCTION

Developed by Merck Frosst Canada in the 1990s as a part of a
drug discovery program to elucidate a selective LTD4
antagonist, montelukast sodium 1 (Singulair) (Figure 1) is

today a widely prescribed medication for the treatment of
asthma and symptoms of seasonal allergies.1 The eﬀorts of
Merck Frosst,
leading to the discovery and eventual
commercialization of Singulair (a once $4.5 billion-a-year
drug before the expiry of its patent in 2012), has often been
cited as a “case
study in modern drug discovery and
development”.1a However, there remains scope both to hone
existing strategies and to develop novel ones which address
shortcomings in known synthetic routes to 1.

A synthetic route generally representative of processes used
for 1 is shown in Scheme 1. This employs a Mizoroki−Heck
reaction of allylic alcohol 3 with methyl 2-iodobenzoate in a key
C−C bond-forming step, followed by asymmetric reduction of
ketone 4. A signiﬁcant drawback of this approach is the methyl
Grignard reagent addition to the aryl ester 5 that leads to the
dimethyl aryl carbinol 6. This requires the use of anhydrous
cerium chloride and a large excess of reagent and involves a
tedious workup procedure on account of emulsion formation
during the solvent extraction process.2
<para sub=“ques”>
We reasoned that the methyl Grignard addition step could be
avoided, and additionally a more streamlined overall route
realized by employing a halide 10 bearing a preformed dimethyl
aryl carbinol moiety in the Mizoroki−Heck reaction step, to
provide the key intermediate 9, from which the diol 6 could be
accessed via asymmetric reduction of the ketone functionality
(Scheme 2).3 This reordering, while superﬁcially straightfor-
ward, poses signiﬁcant challenges in both key steps involved.
First, the Mizoroki−Heck reaction employs, in place of reactive
methyl 2-iodobenzoate, the hindered and less reactive 2-(2-
halophenyl)propan-2-ol 10. Second, a highly enantioselective

As outlined, while providing a shorter synthetic route to the

Eﬀorts to realize the desired Mizoroki−Heck reaction
between 3 and bromide 10b (Scheme 4) met with no success
under a variety of conditions, with and without ligands and
employing a range of bases and solvents; indeed, no reaction of
10b was observed even with ethyl acrylate. The bromocarbinol
10b remained largely unreacted under the conditions tried.
With the iodocarbinol 10c, no reaction occurred using
Pd(OAc)2/Et3N in reﬂuxing acetonitrile (conditions used
commercially for the Mizoroki−Heck reaction between methyl
2-iodobenzoate and 3). However, the reaction was successful
under Jeﬀery conditions (Pd(OAc)2, LiOAc, n-Bu4NCl, LiCl,
DMA). Under these conditions, a loading of down to 0.3 mol %

palladium without prior thorough degassing of the reaction
solvent was achievable, with an isolated yield of 73%. Use of
phosphine ligands in the reaction employing 10c led to
formation of high levels of side products with only partial
consumption of 3. The self-reaction of (2-halophenyl) tertiary
carbinols under palladium catalysis is well-documented in the
literature,5−7 and this was not investigated further.

While the use of the iodide 10c in the Heck−Mizoroki

identiﬁed acetate as a group which combined compatibility with

using the best ligand/solvent/base combination (Table 1, entry

formation of 14, the Mizoroki−Heck reaction between 3 and

<para sub=“opt”>
With the keto-carbinol 9 in hand, we focused our attention
toward developing an eﬃcient method for the enantioselective
reduction of the ketone group in 9. Keto-carbinol 9 contains
several reducible functionalities, including a disubstituted CC
double bond, an aromatic heterocycle, and an aryl chloride.
Hence, in addition to high enantioselectivity, chemoselectivity
is required in the asymmetric reduction of 9. Reported methods
the related ester-containing keto-ester 4
for
(Scheme 1) include stoichiometric (−)-chlorodiisopinocam-
pheylborane ((−)-DIP-Cl),1a,11,12 and catalytic methods
employing borane with catalytic CBS,1a,13 ketoreductase
enzymes,14 asymmetric transfer hydrogenation,2,15 and asym-
metric hydrogenation.16 Despite providing excellent enantiose-
lectivity, CBS reduction of 4 can lead to a signiﬁcant over-
reduction of the CHCH to a CH2-CH2 linkage in the
presence of traces of palladium carried over from the preceding
Mizoroki−Heck reaction step.11 The use of stoichiometric
(−)-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane as an alternate chiral
reducing agent for this step lowers the possibility of over-
reduction, but at increased cost, both of reagents and waste
management, and presents additional diﬃculties
such as
moisture sensitivity and complex workup.2 The alcohol
functionality in keto-carbinol 9 is also likely to react with the
boron-based reagents, resulting in incompatibility or large
excesses of reagent being required. We considered enzymatic
reduction and catalytic hydrogenation3,17,18 to be the most
attractive methods for asymmetric reduction from the point of
view of the use of an economically advantageous reductant

Asymmetric hydrogenation of keto-ester 4 has been reported
using ruthenium(diamine)(diphosphine) catalysts.16 However,
keto-ester 4 is not stable toward base, which is required for
activation of the precatalysts. An approach to minimize the
arising detrimental eﬀects of substrate degradation and catalyst
deactivation is

under conventional reaction conditions with isopropanol as
solvent and potassium tert-butoxide as base, even at a relatively
high catalyst loading (s/c 500:1), the reaction proceeds rapidly,
then stops abruptly within 15 min, with 40% conversion being
reached in this example (Figure 3). A signiﬁcant proportion of
the reaction occurred before the 2 min equilibration time of the
Biotage Endeavor reactor system used for the experiment.
Likewise, base sensitivity of the acetate group in ketone 13,
which was labile in the presence of base and isopropanol, ruled
out asymmetric hydrogenation at this stage using ruthenium-
(diamine)(diphosphine) catalysts, followed by later removal of
the acetate group.

From the high yield obtained in the ﬁnal acetate-removal
step (Scheme 5), it was clear that keto-carbinol 9, unlike keto-
ester 4, was stable toward base, providing an advantage in
ketone hydrogenation. Keto-carbinol 9 was screened against a
range of hydrogenation catalysts (Figure 2, Table 2) under
standard reaction conditions employing isopropanol as solvent
and potassium tert-butoxide as base. Complete conversion was
achieved with ﬁve catalysts, with the other three giving 50% or
higher conversion. Ketone 9 is sparingly soluble in isopropanol,
and the reaction proceeds from a slurry to a solution. The
complete conversion obtained with keto-carbinol 9 with [((R)-
Xyl-BINAP)((R)-DAIPEN)RuCl2] (entry 5) contrasts with the
40% conversion obtained with keto-ester 4 under
these
conditions. Three catalysts gave high enantiomeric excesses
close to or surpassing 98%, with two, [((R)-Xyl-BINAP)-
((R,R)-DPEN)RuCl2] (entry 5) and [((R)-Xyl-SEGPHPOS)-
((R)-DAIPEN)RuCl2] (entry 8), giving over 98.5% enantio-
meric excess. With some catalysts, such as [((S)-PhanePhos)-
((R,R)-DACH)RuCl 2]
and [((R)-Xyl-
SEGPHOS)((R,R)-DPEN)RuCl2 (entry 7), chemical purity
was lower, with signiﬁcant levels of side reactions occurring.
Overall, [((R)-Xyl-BINAP)((R)-DAIPEN)RuCl2] (entry 5),
[((R)-Xyl-BINAP)((R,R)-DPEN)RuCl2] (entry 6), and ((R)-
Xyl-SEGPHOS)((R)-DAIPEN)RuCl2] (entry 8) gave encour-
aging performance in terms of enantioselectivity, reactivity, and
product purity. For this reason, combined with commercial
availability, these catalysts were selected for further optimiza-

Further comparison to determine the optimum catalyst
focused on lowering the catalyst loading (Table 3) at higher
substrate concentration (200 g/L). With ((R)-Xyl-BINAP)-
((R)-DAIPEN)RuCl2, complete conversion at 25 °C and at 40
°C was achievable down to a loading of 2000:1 with no
reduction in enantiomeric excess. Below 2000:1, an erosion in
enantiomeric excess was observed, and below 2500:1,
conversion was incomplete. The gradual reduction in reaction
rate with time and erosion in enantiomeric excess at reduced
catalyst loading point to degradation of the catalyst over the
course of the reaction, thus limiting the loading achievable with
this catalyst. A less pronounced reduction in reaction rate with
time and erosion of enantiomeric excess at reduced catalyst
loading was apparent with [((R)-Xyl-SEGPHOS)((R,R)-
DPEN)RuCl2] (Figure 6). This catalyst also exhibited an
induction period, but shorter than that for [((R)-Xyl-BINAP)-
((R,R)-DPEN)RuCl2]. A reduction of rate with reaction time
and a reduction of enantiomeric excess at lower catalyst loading
were not apparent with [((R)-Xyl-BINAP)((R,R)-DPEN)-
RuCl2], and this catalyst was selected for laboratory scale-up.

reaction, the base was quenched with acetic acid prior to
opening the reaction to the atmosphere,
in order to avoid
formation of strongly colored oxidative catalyst decomposition
products which otherwise tended to contaminate the product.
The inorganic salts were removed by partitioning between
toluene and aqueous sodium carbonate. The crystallization
properties of diol 6 were favorable; after recrystallization from
isopropanol−heptane or toluene−heptane, the enantiomeric
excess of the product increased to 99.6−99.8% in 78−86% yield
and a product purity of 99.4−99.6%, the largest impurity being
unconverted ketone 9 (0.2−0.3%). The diol 6 was converted to
montelukast sodium by known methods.21 The overall route
encapsulating both options for the Mizoroki−Heck reaction is
summarized in Scheme 6.

■ CONCLUSIONS

We describe a concise enantioselective formal synthesis of
montelukast sodium 1 via the key chiral diol intermediate 6,
which addresses some of the shortcomings in the conventional
synthesis of 1, most signiﬁcantly, the late-stage methyl Grignard
addition to the methyl ester group, while also achieving a higher
degree of convergence. This was achieved by employing metal-
based catalysis in two key steps. The ﬁrst of these, namely, the
C−C bond formation in the construction of 9, was a palladium-

catalyzed tandem Mizoroki−Heck reaction and double bond
isomerization between the allyl alcohol 3 and a sterically
hindered dimethyl o-halophenyl carbinol, either the free alcohol
10c in the case of the iodide, or the acetate derivative 11 in the
case of the bromide, to furnish the keto-carbinol 9. With
unprotected 2-(2-iodophenyl)propan-2-ol 10c, the Mizoroki−
Heck coupling could be carried out successfully with a
palladium loading as low as 0.3 mol % without the need of a
phosphine ligand and stringent oxygen-free conditions.
Ruthenium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation was employed
in the ﬁnal enantioselective step. Though several of the Ru
catalysts screened gave high enantioselectivity and activity
under standard monophasic basic reaction conditions, diﬀer-
ences in performance between these catalysts became apparent
at reduced catalyst loading. With [((R)-Xyl-BINAP)((R,R)-
DPEN)RuCl2], it was possible to achieve an enantioselectivity
of 99% ee in the reduction of 9 to 6 at a catalyst loading of
5000:1 on a laboratory scale.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
Methyl 2-Bromobenzoate (11). The title compound was
prepared following a modiﬁcation of a literature protocol.22 Thus, 2-
bromobenzoic acid (50 g, 0.25 mol) was taken in a dry 500 mL three-
neck round-bottom ﬂask, equipped with a stir bar, a reﬂux condenser,
and a calcium chloride guard tube. Methanol (250 mL) was added into
the reaction ﬂask, and the mixture thus obtained was stirred at room
temperature for 15 min in order to dissolve all solids and obtain a pale
yellow clear solution. The reaction mixture was now cooled to 0 °C.
Concentrated H2SO4 (7.94 mL, 0.15 mol) was added dropwise into
the cooled reaction mixture, which was then allowed to reﬂux for 20 h.
Thereafter, the reaction mass was cooled to room temperature and
methanol was evaporated completely from the reaction mixture under
vacuum. The residue, thus obtained, was neutralized carefully with
saturated NaHCO3 solution (100 mL) at 0 °C and then extracted with
hexanes (2 × 250 mL). The organic layers were combined, dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate, and passed through a short silica gel, which
was then washed with EtOAc. The eluates were concentrated under
vacuum to obtain methyl 2-bromobenzoate (51 g, 96% yield, 99%
purity from HPLC analysis) as a clear pale yellow liquid, which was
pure enough to be employed directly for the next step. 1H NMR (400

MHz, CDCl3, 18 °C) δ = 7.78 (dd, J = 7.6, 1.9 Hz, 1H), 7.66 (dd, J =
7.6, 1.4 Hz, 1H), 7.38−7.30 (m, 2H), 3.93 (s, 1H) ppm.

2-(2-Bromophenyl)propan-2-ol (10b).23 (a) Preparation using
MeMgBr. Methyl 2-bromobenzoate (31 g, 0.144 mol) was taken in a
dry 1 L three-neck round-bottom ﬂask, equipped with a stir bar, 500
mL dropping funnel, and a nitrogen inlet. The reaction vessel was
cooled to 0 °C on an ice bath. MeMgBr (366 mL, 1.18 M solution in
THF, 0.432 mol) was added dropwise at 0 °C under nitrogen over a
period of 1 h into the stirred reaction mixture. (The actual
concentration of the stored MeMgBr reagent (originally purchased
as a 1.4 M solution in THF) was estimated by titration against
menthol using 1,10−phenanthroline as the end point
indicator.)
During the course of addition of the Grignard reagent, the reaction
mass turned into a clear pale yellow solution. After the addition of the
Grignard reagent was complete, the reaction mixture was allowed to
stir at 0 °C for an additional 3 h. The reaction mixture gradually
turned into a brown colored suspension during this time. After
complete consumption of the starting material was indicated by TLC
analysis, the reaction mass was quenched at 0 °C with saturated
NH4Cl solution (200 mL). Ethyl acetate (250 mL) was then added,
and the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for
30 min. The organic layer was then separated, and the aqueous layer
was extracted once with ethyl acetate (250 mL). The organic layers
were now combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and
evaporated under vacuum. The residue thus obtained was puriﬁed by
column chromatography using 10% EtOAc−hexanes to obtain 2-(2-
bromophenyl)propan-2-ol (28 g, 90% yield, 99% purity from HPLC
analysis) as a colorless clear liquid. (b) Preparation using MeMgCl.
Methyl 2-bromobenzoate (5 g, 0.023 mol) was taken in a dry 100 mL
three-neck round-bottom ﬂask, equipped with a stir bar and a nitrogen
inlet. The reaction vessel was cooled to 0 °C on an ice bath. MeMgCl
(23.3 mL, 3.0 M in THF, 0.069 mol) was added dropwise at 0 °C over
a period of 20 min into the stirred reaction mixture. During the
addition of the Grignard reagent, the reaction mass turned into an oﬀ-
white suspension. After the addition of the Grignard reagent was
complete, the reaction mixture was allowed to stir at 0 °C. The
reaction mixture gradually turned into a sticky mass over a period of 1
h. In order to facilitate the stirring at this stage, dry THF (10 mL) was
introduced into the reaction mixture at 0 °C under nitrogen. After the
addition of THF, the reaction mixture gradually converted into the
same oﬀ-white suspension as obtained during the addition of MeMgCl.
The reaction mixture was now allowed to stir at 0 °C for an additional
5 h, after which TLC analysis showed complete consumption of the

starting material and formation of the desired product. The reaction
mass was quenched at 0 °C with saturated NH4Cl solution (25 mL)
and then extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 25 mL). The organic layers
were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated
under vacuum to obtain a pale yellow liquid that was puriﬁed by
column chromatography to obtain 2-(2-bromophenyl)propan-2-ol
(4.1 g, 82% yield, 98% purity from HPLC analysis) as a colorless
liquid. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 18 °C) δ = 7.67 (dd, J = 7.8, 1.7

2-(2-Bromophenyl)propan-2-yl Acetate (12). (a) Preparation
·Et2O. 2-(2-Bromophenyl)propan-2-ol
using Ac2O and catalytic BF3
(2 g, 0.009 mol) was taken in a dry 25 mL round-bottom ﬂask,
equipped with a stir bar and a nitrogen inlet. Dry dichloromethane (7
mL),
followed by acetic anhydride (1.1 mL, 0.012 mol), was
introduced into the reaction ﬂask at room temperature via the
standard syringe and septum technique. The resulting reaction mixture
·Et2O (4
was stirred at 0 °C to obtain a colorless clear solution. BF3
drops, ∼2 μL, 1.8 × 10−5 mol) was now added to the reaction mixture
at 0 °C, which was then stirred at the same temperature for 6 h.
Thereafter, the reaction mass was quenched with saturated NaHCO3
solution (20 mL). The organic layer was separated, and the aqueous
layer was extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 15 mL). The organic
layers were now combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and
evaporated under vacuum. The pale yellow liquid thus obtained was
puriﬁed by column chromatography using 10% EtOAc−hexanes to
obtain the acetate 12 (1.7 g, 71% yield, 99% purity from HPLC
analysis) as a colorless liquid. (b) Preparation using Ac2O and
catalytic DMAP. 2-(2-Bromophenyl)propan-2-ol (27 g, 0.125 mol)
was taken in a dry 500 mL three-neck round-bottom ﬂask, equipped
with a stir bar, condenser, and a nitrogen inlet. Heptane (285 mL),
followed by acetic anhydride (32 g, 0.314 mol) and DMAP (0.459 g,
0.0038 mol), was introduced into the reaction ﬂask at
room
temperature under a ﬂow of nitrogen. The resulting reaction mixture
was stirred and reﬂuxed for 24 h under nitrogen [Note: an additional
lot of DMAP (0.460 g, 0.0038 mol) was added into the reaction
mixture after 12 h of reﬂux]. The reaction mixture was then allowed to
reﬂux at 100 °C for an additional 20 h. After TLC analysis showed
complete consumption of the starting material, the reaction mixture
was cooled to room temperature and quenched with saturated
NaHCO3 solution (100 mL). Thereafter,
the heptane layer was
separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 ×
250 mL). The organic layers were now combined, dried over
anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated under vacuum to obtain a
brown colored liquid. Puriﬁcation of
residue by column
chromatography aﬀorded the acetate 12 (27 g, 87% yield, 99% purity
from HPLC analysis) as a colorless liquid. 1H NMR (400 MHz,
CDCl3, 18 °C) δ = 7.67 (dd, J = 7.8, 1.7 Hz, 1H), 7.57 (dd, J = 7.8, 1.2

Mizoroki−Heck Reaction between the Acetate 12 and Allyl
Alcohol 3: Preparation of (E)-2-(2-(3-(3-(2-(7-Chloroquinolin-2-
yl)vinyl)phenyl)-3-oxopropyl)phenyl)propan-2-yl Acetate (13).
DMA and DIPEA (10 mL) were degassed thoroughly by the freeze−
pump−thaw technique. The acetate 12 (7.3 g, 0.0284 mol), allyl
alcohol 3 (7.2 g, 0.0224 mol), Pd(OAc)2 trimer (0.146 g, 0.00021
mol), (o-tolyl)3P (0.397 g, 0.0013 mol), and degassed DIPEA (3.514 g,
0.027 mol) were introduced into degassed DMA (100 mL) taken in a
dry 250 mL round-bottom ﬂask, equipped with a stir bar, condenser,
and a nitrogen inlet. The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature to dissolve the solids and obtain a clear orange colored
solution. The reaction vessel was then dipped into an oil bath heated
to 120 °C, and the reaction mass was stirred at the same temperature
for 18 h when complete consumption of 3, as indicated by TLC
analysis, was noted. The reaction mass was now cooled to 0 °C,

this

diluted with ice-cold water (500 mL), and stirred for 30 min,
whereupon an oﬀ-white gummy material precipitated out of the
reaction mixture and clung to the walls of the reaction vessel. The
aqueous layer was decanted oﬀ, and the solid residue was washed with
water (100 mL). The aqueous layer and washings were extracted with
MTBE (2 × 200 mL). These MTBE extracts and THF (200 mL) were
used to dissolve the precipitated gummy material in the reaction vessel.
(The gummy residue in the reaction ﬂask was sparingly soluble in
MTBE, but dissolved gradually in THF to leave behind a small amount
of gray solid.) The solution thus obtained was ﬁltered, and the ﬁltrate
was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated under
vacuum to obtain 15 g of an oﬀ-white solid. The crude material was
washed with hexanes, which removed some of the nonpolar impurities.
The solid thereafter was made into a slurry in 120 mL of toluene,
stirred for 1 h at room temperature, and ﬁnally ﬁltered. The residue
thus obtained was washed with 50 mL of toluene and dried under
vacuum to yield the desired product 13 as a grayish-yellow solid. This
was puriﬁed further by dissolving it in 1:1 THF−methanol at 50 °C,
ﬁltering the solution through a Celite bed to ﬁlter the precipitated Pd
metal and concentrating the ﬁltrate to obtain 6.6 g of crude 13 as a
pale yellow solid. Concentrating the toluene washings and puriﬁcation
of the residue by column chromatography using 30% EtOAc−hexanes
aﬀorded an additional 1 g of the desired product 13. The combined
yield of the Mizoroki−Heck reaction product (95% purity from HPLC
analysis) was around 70%. 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6, 18 °C) δ

charged at room temperature into a mixture of THF (56.9 mL) and
methanol (37.4 mL), taken in a dry 25 mL round-bottom ﬂask
equipped with a stir bar, condenser, and a nitrogen inlet. KOH (1.436
g, 0.025 mol) was added to the stirred suspension at room temperature
under a ﬂow of nitrogen. The reaction mixture was then allowed to stir
at 45 °C for 6 h. During this interval, the initial yellow colored
suspension gradually became a brown colored solution. Upon
complete consumption of the starting material, as indicated by TLC,
the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and treated with
saturated Na2SO4 solution (40 mL). The organic layer was decanted
oﬀ, and the solid residue was dissolved in 50 mL of water. The
aqueous layer thus obtained was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 100
mL). The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium
sulfate, and then evaporated under vacuum to obtain a yellow
semisolid. The crude residue thus obtained was puriﬁed by column

round-bottom ﬂask, equipped with a stir bar, condenser, and calcium
chloride guard tube. The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature in order to dissolve all solids and obtain a clear colorless
solution. Concentrated H2SO4 (0.9 mL) was added dropwise into the
reaction mixture at room temperature. The reaction mass was now
allowed to reﬂux for 24 h, after which it was allowed to cool to room
temperature. Methanol was then evaporated completely from the
reaction mixture under vacuum, and the brown syrupy liquid obtained
was neutralized carefully with saturated NaHCO3 solution (20 mL).
The product was extracted into hexanes (2 × 50 mL). The organic
layers were combined and passed through a short silica gel plug, which
was subsequently washed with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The eluted
fractions, containing the product, were concentrated under vacuum to
obtain 11c (7 g, 94% yield, 99% purity from HPLC analysis) as a clear
pale yellow liquid, which was pure enough to be employed directly for
the next step. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 18 °C) δ = 7.99 (dd, J =

2-(2-Iodophenyl)propan-2-ol (10c). The title compound was
prepared following a modiﬁcation of a literature protocol.24 Thus,
magnesium turnings (1.17 g, 0.0488 mol) were taken in a dry 100 mL
two-neck round-bottom ﬂask, equipped with a stir bar, condenser, and
an argon inlet. The reaction vessel was now evacuated, ﬂame-dried
under vacuum, and then allowed to cool under argon. Dry Et2O (20
mL) was added into the reaction ﬂask. A solution of methyl iodide
(3.34 mL, 0.053 mol) in dry Et2O (10 mL) was now introduced
dropwise at room temperature over a period of 30 min. Thereafter, the
reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 h to
ensure complete consumption of magnesium. The MeMgI solution,
thus prepared, was now cooled to 0 °C. A solution of methyl 2-
iodobenzoate 11c (4 g, 0.0152 mol) in dry Et2O (10 mL) was added
dropwise into the cooled MeMgI solution over a period of 15 min.
The reaction mixture obtained was allowed to warm to room
temperature and then reﬂuxed for 1 h when the initial green colored
reaction mass turned into a brown colored suspension. The progress of
the reaction was checked by TLC. Upon complete consumption of the
starting material, the reaction mass was ﬁrst cooled to 0 °C, and then
added dropwise into a stirred mixture of saturated NH4Cl solution (50
mL), ice, and diethyl ether (20 mL). After 30 min of stirring, the
organic layer was separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with
diethyl ether (2 × 50 mL). The organic layers were combined, dried
over potassium carbonate, and evaporated under vacuum to obtain a
brown colored syrup (3.26 g, containing about 89% 10c) that was
employed directly for the next step. The proportion of the required
iodo-carbinol
in the crude product mixture was determined by
comparing its HPLC chromatogram with that of a sample, puriﬁed
from the crude product mixture by column chromatography and
subsequently characterized on the basis of 1H NMR. The iodo-
carbinol 10c not only was sensitive to light but also decomposed
gradually on a silica-gel column. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, 18 °C)

Mizoroki−Heck Reaction between the Iodo-Carbinol 10c
and Allyl Alcohol 3: (E)-1-(3-(2-(7-Chloroquinolin-2-yl)vinyl)-
phenyl)-3-(2-(2-hydroxypropan-2-yl)phenyl)propan-1-one (9).
Dimethylacetamide (14 mL), brieﬂy sparged with nitrogen for 15 min,
was taken in a 50 mL round-bottom ﬂask, equipped with a stir bar,
nitrogen inlet, and air condenser. The crude sample of 10c (3.2 g, 89%
purity from HPLC, 11 mmol) obtained in the previous step was
charged into the reaction vessel at room temperature along with the
allyl alcohol 3 (2.33 g, 7.2 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 trimer (4.8 mg, 0.007
mmol),
tetrabutylammonium
chloride (5.03 g, 1.8 mmol), and lithium chloride (377 mg, 8.9 mmol).
The reaction mixture obtained was stirred at room temperature for 15
min and then at 120 °C for 1.5 days until complete consumption of
the starting material was noted. The progress of the reaction was
monitored by TLC and HPLC/LC-MS. HPLC/LC-MS analysis of the
reaction mixture showed the following proﬁle with time: (a) after 14 h:
32% 9, 16% 3; (b) after 24 h: 60% 9, 6% 3; (c) after 30 h: 81% 9, 0%

lithium acetate (1.48 g, 22.4 mol),

3. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mass was cooled to
room temperature, diluted with 100 mL of ice-cold water, and then
allowed to stir at room temperature for 15 min when a dark colored
gummy material separated out. The aqueous layer was decanted oﬀ
and extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 100 mL). The dichloro-
methane extracts were now used to dissolve the precipitated gummy
material in the reaction vessel. The entire solution obtained was dried
over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated under vacuum to
obtain a dark colored gummy mass. This was puriﬁed by column
chromatography to obtain the Mizoroki−Heck reaction product 9 as a
pale yellow solid (2.5 g, 73%, 94% purity from HPLC analysis).

Small-Scale Preparation of

(202 mg), KRED-NADH-129 (13.5 mg, 150U), GDH-102 (0.7 mg,
100U) and NAD+ (3.2 mg) in 50 mM phosphate buﬀer pH 7.0 (9.5
mL), 0.5 mL of a 100 mg/mL solution of the ketone 9 in DMSO was
added, and the ensuing mixture was stirred at 25 °C, while maintaining
the pH at 7.0 with 1 M NaOH. Samples were prepared for assay by
diluting a 25 mL aliquot of the reaction to 1 mL with MeCN and
drying (MgSO4). The liquid was decanted oﬀ and analyzed by SFC
(vide infra). When the reaction had stopped, the mixture was extracted
with EtOAc (2 × 10 mL). Emulsions were removed from the organic
layer by ﬁltration through Celite. The organic layer was then washed
with sat. brine (10 mL), dried (MgSO4), ﬁltered, and concentrated in
vacuo to give the product as a colorless oil (30 mg). This was
determined to be 60:40 9:6 by both NMR and SFC. The ee of the
alcohol was determined as >99% by SFC.

Small-Scale Preparation of

(2-(2-(3-(3(S)-(2-(7-Chloro-2-
quinolinyl)ethenyl)phenyl)-3-hydroxypropyl)phenyl)-2-propa-

catalyst screening system was charged with the ketone 9 (880 mg, 1.92
mmol). The vessel was purged with nitrogen (5 × 10 bar); then,
deoxygenated isopropyl alcohol (2.4 mL) was added. A solution of
[((R)-Xyl-BINAP)((R)-DAIPEN)RuCl2] (2.23 mg, 0.0018 mmol) in
deoxygenated isopropanol (2.37 mL) was prepared, and a 1.0 mL
(0.00076 mmol) aliquot of this solution was added to the vessel. A
solution of potassium tert-butoxide (1.0 M in THF, 0.93 mL) in
deoxygenated isopropyl alcohol (8 mL) was prepared. A 1.0 mL
aliquot of this solution was charged to the vessel; then, the vessel was
pressurized to 0.8 bar with hydrogen. The vessel was heated to 40 °C
and then pressurized to 8 bar with hydrogen and stirred for 18 h at 8
bar hydrogen pressure and 40 °C while monitoring hydrogen uptake,
which showed completion to have occurred after 2 h. The temperature
was allowed to fall to room temperature, the pressure was released,
and then a solution of acetic acid (0.2 mL, approximately 0.19 mmol of
a solution of 265 μL, 4.62 mmol in isopropanol (4.5 mL)) was added.
The solvent was evaporated to give (S)-6 (96.9%ee) as a brown,
viscous oil (conversion by 1H NMR, 100%).

pressure vessel was charged with the ketone 9 (20.0 g, 43.9 mmol)
and isopropanol (100 mL). The vessel was purged with nitrogen (5 ×
7 bar); then, solutions of [((R)-Xyl-BINAP)((R,R)-DPEN)RuCl2]
(9.8 mg, 0.0088 mmol) in deoxygenated isopropanol (1 mL) and
potassium tert-butoxide (1.0 M in THF, 3.51 mL) were added. The
vessel was pressurized to 7.6 bar with hydrogen and then heated to 40
°C while stirring. Initially, the pressure rose to 8.0 bar. After 3.5 h,
uptake stopped at 5.9 bar. The reaction was stirred for a further 30 min
and then cooled to 30 °C, the pressure was released, and acetic acid
(251 μL, 4.39 mmol) was added. A small sample was withdrawn and
analyzed showing the enantiomeric excess of the crude 6 to be 98.8%
(S). About 70 mL of solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator.
Toluene (50 mL) and 10% sodium carbonate solution (25 mL) were
added, the mixture was shaken, and the layers were separated. The
aqueous phase was extracted with toluene (50 mL), the combined
organic phases were dried (Na2SO4) and ﬁltered, and about 60 mL of
solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator. The solution was
seeded with a small quantity of 6 and stirred for 30 min; then, heptane
(50 mL) was added over 4 h. The suspension was stirred for 18 h and
