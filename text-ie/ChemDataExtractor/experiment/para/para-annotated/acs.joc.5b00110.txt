ABSTRACT: An orthogonally protected hypusine reagent was developed for solid-phase
synthesis of hypusinated peptides using the Fmoc/t-Bu protection strategy. The reagent was
synthesized in an overall yield of 27% after seven steps from Cbz-Lys-OBzl and (R)-3-
hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one. The side-chain protecting groups (Boc and t-Bu) are fully
compatible with standard Fmoc chemistry and can be readily removed during the peptide
cleavage step. The utility of the reagent was demonstrated by solid-phase synthesis of hypusinated peptides.

U nusual amino acids widely exist in organisms. Many of

them are formed by posttranslational modiﬁcations
(PTMs) of natural proteinogenic amino acids and play
important roles in various biological processes.1 (+)-Hypusine
((2S,9R)-2,11-diamino-9-hydroxy-7-azaundecanoic acid, 1, Fig-
ure 1) is a PTM derivative of lysine that was ﬁrst isolated from

Figure 1. Structures of hypusine derivatives.

homogenates of bovine brain in 1971.2 Eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 5A (eIF5A) is the only known cellular protein
that contains hypusine. Research has shown that eIF5A plays a
key role in the viability and proliferation of eukaryotic cells,3
and is overexpressed in a number of human cancers.4 The
activity of eIF5A is modulated by the formation of hypusine
that involves two enzymatic reactions. A speciﬁc lysine residue
in eIF5A is ﬁrst modiﬁed with the 4-aminobutyl moiety of
spermidine by deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS), followed by the
deoxyhypusine hydroxylase (DOHH)-catalyzed hydroxylation.5
Over the past decade, eIF5A and hypusination have attracted
increasing attention as a potential diagnostic marker and a drug
target.4,6 Synthetic hypusinated peptides are of great interest in
order
functions of eIF5A.
Although several synthetic methods for free hypusine have
been reported,7 the orthogonal protection of the side-chain

to elucidate the physiological

functionalities remains as a challenge for the incorporation of
hypusine into peptide sequences. In 1997, Bergeron et al.
developed a protected hypusine reagent (2, Figure 1) for
peptide synthesis.8 The α-amino group of hypusine was
protected with Fmoc (9-ﬂuorenylmethoxycarbonyl), and the
side-chain amino groups and hydroxyl group were protected
with Cbz (benzyloxycarbonyl) and THP (tetrahydropyranyl),
respectively. The reagent was successfully used for the synthesis
of hypusinated peptides.8,9 However, the side-chain protecting
groups cannot be removed by standard TFA (triﬂuoroacetic
acid) cleavage, and the deprotection required the treatment
with HBr in TFA. The extra deprotection step caused not only
inconvenience but also decreased peptide purity due to the
harsh reaction conditions.10
<para sub=“ques”>
In an eﬀort to develop automated solid-phase synthesis of
hypusinated peptides, we designed a new orthogonally
protected hypusine derivative (3, Figure 1) using the standard
Fmoc/t-Bu protection strategy. The α-amino group was
protected with Fmoc for solid-phase peptide elongation. Boc
(tert-butoxycarbonyl) and t-Bu (tert-butyl) were selected to
protect
the side-chain amino groups and hydroxyl group,
respectively. The acid-labile side-chain protecting groups are
fully compatible with standard Fmoc chemistry and can be
readily removed during the peptide cleavage step. The hypusine
molecule contains three amino groups, one hydroxyl group, and
one carboxyl group. We envisioned that the selective protection
would be diﬃcult once the molecule was assembled. Therefore,
the protection should start with the synthons.

The synthesis of

the orthogonally protected hypusine
derivative is illustrated in Scheme 1. The key step of the
synthesis involved the reductive alkylation of a commercially
available lysine derivative, Cbz-Lys-OBzl (8), with an aldehyde
equivalent (7) that was derivatized from (R)-3-hydroxypyrro-
lidin-2-one (4). The hydroxyl group of 4 was ﬁrst protected
with t-Bu in 68% yield by the treatment with isobutene in the
presence of p-TsOH (p-toluenesulfonic acid).11 Subsequent
reaction of the lactam 5 with Boc2O (di-tert-butyl dicarbonate)
aﬀorded intermediate 6 in 97% yield.12 The product was
analyzed with chiral HPLC, and no racemization was observed.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Initial attempts to reduce intermediate 6 with DIBAL-H
failed to give the desired product.13 Reduction of 6 with NaBH4
at −40 °C aﬀorded intermediate 7 in 28% yield, but the yield
decreased at higher temperature due to the formation of the
overreduction product. Finally, the aldehyde equivalent 7 was
obtained by reduction with LiAlH4 at −78 °C in quantitative
yield.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Various combinations of reagents, solvents, and conditions
were tested for the reductive alkylation of Cbz-Lys-OBzl (8)
with intermediate 7. The best
result was achieved with
NaBH3CN in THF at 60 °C in the presence of HOAc.
Under these conditions, the key intermediate 9 was obtained in
70% yield. SFC (supercritical ﬂuid chromatography) and NMR
analysis indicated that compound 9 was the sole product of the
reductive alkylation. There was no detectable epimerization

probably because the reaction proceeded via a cyclic N-
acyliminium ion intermediate instead of a ring-opened imine.14
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Intermediate 9 was then reacted with Boc2O to complete the
protection of the side-chain functionalities in hypusine. The
fully protected hypusine derivative 10 was obtained in 88%
yield. Hydrogenation of 10 catalyzed by Pd/C resulted in
intermediate 11, which was subsequently protected with Fmoc-
OSu without puriﬁcation.15 The ﬁnal product 3 was obtained in
67% yield from 10 over two steps. A small amount of 3 was
treated with 10% piperidine in ACN (acetonitrile) and
subsequently 4 M HCl in 1,4-dioxane to aﬀord hypusine 1 in
72% yield as its dihydrochloride salt ([α]D

(0.1 mmol), followed by the addition of a solution of HBTU (0.2 M)
and NMM (0.4 M) in DMF (1.5 mL) and DCM (1 mL). The
resulting mixture was purged with nitrogen at room temperature for 1
h. The supernatant was drained, and the resin was washed with DMF
(4 mL × 3). For Fmoc deprotection, 20% piperidine/DMF (4 mL)

was added to the resin. The resulting mixture was purged with
nitrogen at room temperature for 10 min. The supernatant was
drained, and the process was repeated once. The resin was then
washed thoroughly with DMF (4 mL × 6). The coupling−
deprotection cycle was repeated until
the peptide assembly was
complete. For peptide cleavage, the resin was washed thoroughly with
MeOH (4 mL × 3) and DCM (4 mL × 3), and then dried in vacuo. A
mixture of TFA/phenol/water/thioanisole/3,6-dioxa-1,8-octane-
dithiol/triisopropylsilane (v/w/v/v/v/v 82.5:3.75:5:3.75:2.5:2.5, 4
mL) was added to the resin at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was
slowly warmed to room temperature and allowed to mix for 4 h. The
supernatant was collected by ﬁltration, and the resin was washed with
the cleavage mixture (1 mL × 3). The combined ﬁltrate was
concentrated under reduced pressure to a small volume, which was
diluted with anhydrous ether (45 mL). The resulting mixture was
allowed to stand at 0 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged. The
precipitate was washed with anhydrous ether (45 mL × 3) and dried in
vacuo. The crude peptide was analyzed with LC-MS and puriﬁed by
HPLC.

Sample Preparation of eIF5A(48-55) Peptides for LC-MS/MS
Analysis. Protein samples were reduced with 10 mM DTT
(dithiothreitol) in 1× SDS sample buﬀer at 95 °C for 5 min and
loaded on 4−12% Bis-Tris gel. The protein band corresponding to
eIF5A was excised and further destained in 50 mM NH4HCO3 in 30%
ACN/water, and then dehydrated in 100% ACN. Gel pieces were
rehydrated with 10 ng/μL trypsin in 25 mM NH4HCO3 and chilled on
ice for 1 h. Excess trypsin solution was removed, and digestion was
performed in 25 mM NH4HCO3 at 37 °C overnight. Peptides were
extracted with 50% ACN/water containing 0.1% TFA, followed by
100% ACN. Heavy isotope labeled hypusinated peptides were spiked
in at 250 fmol. The peptide mixture was dried to completion and
resuspended in 2% ACN/water containg 0.1% FA (formic acid).

LC-MS/MS Analysis of eIF5A(48-55) Peptides. Peptide digest
containing 250 fmol of heavy isotopically labeled peptides was
analyzed with LC-MS/MS (C18 column, 1.7 mm, 0.1 × 100 mm) with
a ﬂow rate of 1 μL/min and a gradient of 2−25% Solvent B (where
Solvent A is 0.1% FA/2% ACN/water and Solvent B is 0.1% FA/2%
water/ACN) applied over 35 min with a total analysis time of 60 min.
Precursor ions were analyzed in the FTMS at 60 000 resolution; MS/
MS was performed in data dependent mode, whereby the top 15 most
abundant
fragmentation. Extracted ion
chromatograms of the endogenous (light) and heavy labeled peptides
were generated, and area under the curves (AUC) was integrated.
Abundance measurements were calculated for each analyte peptide as
the ratio of light to heavy peptides.
