ABSTRACT: A simple and inexpensive methodology is reported for
the
conversion of alkenes to 1,2-dibromo alkanes via oxidative bromination using
HBr paired with dimethyl sulfoxide, which serves as the oxidant as well as
cosolvent. The substrate scope includes 21 oleﬁns brominated in good to
excellent yields. Three of six styrene derivatives yielded bromohydrins under the
reaction conditions.

V icinal dibromoalkanes (2) are useful synthetic precursors

to cyclopropanes,1 alkynes,2 and vinyl bromides of value
in cross-coupling chemistry.2,3 Their various preparations from
alkenes (1) can be classiﬁed into three general approaches: (1)
treatment with molecular bromine in halogenated solvent4 or
alternative media,5 (2) treatment with a bromine carrying agent
such as a tribromide salt6 or analogous reagent,7 and (3)
treatment with bromide in the presence of a stoichiometric
oxidant such as Oxone,8 H2O2,9 O2,10 Selectﬂuor,11 and
others12 (Scheme 1). The third of these strategies, oxidative

applicability of DMSO in the context of oxidative bromination.
We began by treating allylbenzene (3) with four bromide
reagents in DMSO (Table 1).

solution to
electrophilic halogenation which employs haloperoxidase
(H2O2) or ﬂavin-dependent halogenase (O2) enzymes to
produce X+ from X−.13 In their 2008 comparative review of 24
methods, Eissen and Lenoir concluded that many modern
bromination methods that circumvent the use of molecular
bromine suﬀer from signiﬁcantly higher resource demands and
waste production compared to the traditional choice of Br2 in
CHCl3.14 The authors emphasize the need for continued
development in this ﬁeld and highlight oxidative bromination in
general, and the use of H2O2/HBr speciﬁcally,9c as the most
favorable of current methods based on a number of
environmental, health, and safety factors.

Herein we present our discovery of a simple oxidative
bromination of oleﬁns using HBr and dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent widely used for
synthetic applications at all scales.15 In the presence of various
activating reagents, DMSO is a mild oxidant that has been
employed primarily for the oxidation of alcohols.16 DMSO-
based oxidations are metal-free, mild, and inexpensive. For
these reasons, we are interested in expanding the use of this
<para sub=“opt”>
Although no reaction occurred with Bu4NBr, KBr, or NaBr in
DMSO, we were pleased to observe that HBr yielded some of
the desired 2,3-dibromopropylbenzene (4, entry 4). The
reaction did not proceed when DMSO was replaced with
chloroform (entry 5), in which case trace hydrobromination
was observed but most of the substrate remained unreacted.

In previous literature, the pairing of HBr and DMSO has
been used for the α oxidation of ketones,17 bromination of
arenes,18 and benzylic oxidation.19 In most cases,
it was
believed that HBr reacts with DMSO to yield bromodime-
thylsulfonium bromide (BDMS, 5), a well-established electro-
philic bromination reagent that is more commonly prepared
from dimethyl sulﬁde and bromine.20 BDMS is an orange solid
that precipitates from dichloromethane solution upon addition
of DMS and Br2.21 Most commonly, this reagent has been used
to brominate various arenes and carbonyl derivatives.20 In 2008,

BDMS in acetonitrile.22 Earlier, similar reaction conditions
were employed by Chow and Bakker to form 1-bromo-2-
sulfonium bromides, such as 7, which precipitated in low yields
upon treatment of oleﬁns with BDMS in CH2Cl2 or CH3CN at
0 °C (Scheme 2a).23

giving trans-1,2-dibromocyclohexane (8) in 72% isolated yield.
Conversion of cyclooctene was also complete at
room
temperature in 24 h to give 20 in 99% yield. The temperature
was also lowered for two other substrates, acenaphthylene and
cis-jasmone, to minimize the formation of unidentiﬁed side
products. In these cases, the desired dibromoalkanes 21 and 22
were obtained in 67% and 50% yield after 32 and 24 h,
respectively. A reaction time of 40 h at 65 °C was required for
complete conversion of
trans-stilbene to the corresponding

acids are well tolerated under these reaction conditions with
compounds 24 and 25 obtained in good yields. Compound 25

We next applied this reaction to a series of styrene derivatives
(Table 4). Styrene (30), p-bromostyrene (32), and m-
methoxystyrene (34) behaved as expected, giving the
corresponding dibromides in good yields. However,
in the
case of α-methylstyrene (36), we observed nearly exclusive
formation of the trans-bromohydrin 37 which was isolated in

93% yield. Similarly 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (38) and indene
(40) aﬀorded trans-bromohydrins 39 and 41, respectively, in
good isolated yields. In these two cases, a small amount of
dibromination was also observed via crude 1H NMR. A control
experiment was conducted to determine the potential that
bromohydrins 37, 39, and 41 are formed via initial bromination
and subsequent substitution of −Br with −OH. We subjected
1,2-dibromoindane (prepared via standard Br2-based bromina-
tion of indene) to our HBr/DMSO reaction conditions. We
observed complete conversion of 1,2-dibromoindane to
bromohydrin 41 in 12 h. Thus, it is possible that substrates
36, 38, and 40 undergo initial dibromination before conversion
to bromohydrins. The isolated bomohydrins have a trans
relationship between hydroxyl and bromide groups. Therefore,
if a substitution of −Br
the observed
stereochemistry indicates an SN1 process whereby a carbocation
intermediate reacts with water at its less sterically hindered face.

General Considerations. Unless otherwise noted, commercially
available reagents and solvents were used without further puriﬁcation.
Infrared spectra were obtained on a Thermo Scientiﬁc Nicolet 380 FT-
IR spectrometer as thin ﬁlms on ZnSe disks, and peaks are reported in
cm−1. 1H and 13C NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker
AVANCE 500 MHz instrument, and samples were obtained in CDCl3
(referenced to 7.26 ppm for 1H and 77.0 ppm for 13C). Coupling
constants (J) are reported in hertz. The multiplicities of the signals are
described using the following abbreviations: s = singlet, d = doublet, t
= triplet, m = multiplet, br = broad. MALDI-HRMS of compounds
were recorded on a Q-TOF mass
spectrometer using 2,5-
dihydroxybenzoic acid as a matrix and mixture of polyethylene glycol
(PEG 600) and (PEG 1000) as internal calibration standards.
Elemental analyses were obtained on a CE0440 elemental analyzer
(EAI Exeter Analytical). Reaction progress was monitored by thin-
layer chromatography (TLC, EMD Chemicals, Inc., silica gel 60
F254), visualized under UV light, and plates were developed using p-
anisaldehyde or potassium permanganate stains. Flash chromatography
was performed using silica gel (Sorbent Technologies, particle size
40−63 μm). Melting points were determined using a Mel-Temp II
apparatus and are uncorrected.

General Procedure for Dibromination Reaction. A solution of
HBr (48% aq, 5 equiv) in DMSO (1 mL per mmol of substrate) was
added to a reaction vial containing a magnetic stir bar and the alkene
substrate (0.5−1.0 mmol) in CHCl3 (1 mL per mmol of substrate).
The reaction vial was capped and stirred at the speciﬁed temperature
(rt or 65 °C) until complete disappearance of starting material was
observed by TLC or 1H NMR (TLC plates visualized using p-
anisaldehyde or potassium permanganate stains). The reaction was
transferred to a separatory funnel containing water and extracted with
ether (3 × 30 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried over
MgSO4, and solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was puriﬁed
by ﬂash column chromatography on silica gel (gradient elution with
EtOAc and hexanes). Note: Flash chromatography effectively removes all
trace DMSO that may remain after workup.

used with allylbenzene (132.5 μL, 1.0 mmol), HBr (48% aq, 0.56 mL,
