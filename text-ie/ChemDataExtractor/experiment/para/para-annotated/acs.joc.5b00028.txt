ABSTRACT: A systematic series of anion receptors based on
bidentate halogen bonding by halo-triazoles and -triazoliums is
presented. The inﬂuence of the halogen bond donor atom, the
electron-withdrawing group, and the linker group that bridges
the two donor moieties
investigated. Additionally, a
comparison with hydrogen bond-based analogues is provided.
A new, eﬃcient synthetic approach to introduce diﬀerent
halogens into the heterocycles is established using silver(I)-
triazolylidenes, which are converted to the corresponding halo-
1,2,3-triazoliums with diﬀerent halogens. Comprehensive
nuclear magnetic resonance binding studies supported by
isothermal titration calorimetry studies were performed with
diﬀerent halides and oxo-anions to evaluate the inﬂuence of key parameters of the halogen bond donor, namely, polarization of
the halogen and the bond angle to the anion. The results show a larger anion aﬃnity in the case of more charge-dense halides as
well as a general preference of the receptors to bind oxo-anions, in particular sulfate, over halides.

■ INTRODUCTION

Owing to the importance of anions in biological and chemical
processes, considerable research eﬀorts have been devoted to
the design of selective anion binding sites.1 Although anion
detection based on hydrogen bonds, ion−ion, Lewis acid−base,
and anion−π interactions has been intensively studied,2−4 the
potential of (charge-assisted) halogen bonds5 for selective
anion recognition was realized only recently.6,7 Subsequently,
comprehensive studies have shown great potential of
the
halogen bond for the application in anion sensing,8,9 organo-
catalysis,10−20 and anion-templated construction of interlocked
structures.8,21−26

Halogen bonds are supramolecular interactions between a
Lewis base (Y) and a Lewis-acidic region (σ hole27) of a
covalently bound halogen (X).5,27−30 This region of positive
electrostatic potential
is the result of an electron-density
displacement upon bond formation between X and an electron-
withdrawing group (E) and is thus located on the opposite end
of the E−X bond. The size of the σ hole and, consequently, the
strength of
the halogen bond depends on the eﬀective
electronegativity of E as well as on the polarizability of X
with the latter increasing in the order Cl < Br < I.27,28,30 The
halogen bond features a strong preference for a bond angle

(E−X···Y) close to 180° in order to minimize electronic
repulsion with the electron-rich belt surrounding the hole.31,32
This orientational preference is much more pronounced than
that for the analogous hydrogen bond, which gives rise to the
construction of highly directional and selective anion binding
sites. Another advantage of halogen bond-based systems is their
ability to bind also soft anions, such as iodide, very eﬀectively,
which is tentatively assigned to a larger covalent contribution
toward the halogen bond interactions.26,29,33
To date, neutral systems based on perﬂuoroiodo are-
nes 3 1 , 3 3 , 3 7− 4 2
and cationic halo-imidazolium sys-
tems8,9,13,33,34,36,43,44 have been established as halogen bond
donors. Recently, it was demonstrated that the nitrogen-rich
1,2,3-triazole and -triazolium systems feature strongly polarized
C−H/C−X bonds, which enable strong (charge-assisted)
hydrogen/halogen bonds.29 Although halide abstraction with
1,3-bis(iodo-1,2,3-triazolium)benzene receptors14 and the
anion aﬃnity of several
iodo-1,2,3-triazolium-based recep-

triazoliums has been absent to date. Even on structurally related
bidentate receptors, only a few detailed binding studies have
been reported (Scheme 1).9,32−34 Therefore, we study herein
the eﬀect of each tunable property of cleft-type halogen bond
donors, namely, the polarization of X, the bond angle to the
anion, and the inﬂuence of the anion itself (Scheme 2). We

were interested in further developing anion receptors based on
halo-1,2,3-triazoles and -triazoliums owing to their facile and
modular synthesis via copper(I)-catalyzed azide−alkyne cyclo-
addition (CuAAC).29,47−50 For comparison, hydrogen-bond
analogues and 1,2,4-triazole analogous receptors were also
synthesized and investigated.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Synthesis. The 1,2,3-triazole moiety can be obtained
through the facile and modular CuAAC reaction (Scheme
3).29,47,48,51 With this method, cleft-type hydrogen bond donors
like 1,3-bis(1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)benzene 1 (Scheme 4a) can be
readily prepared.52,53 To synthesize the corresponding halogen
bond donors, the relatively high C−H acidity in the 5-position
of the 1,2,3-triazole (pKa = 28)29 can be exploited. Accordingly,
regioselective metalation by n-BuLi and the subsequent
treatment with iodine aﬀorded 5-iodo-1,2,3-triazole-based

receptor 1a (Scheme 4a);54 however,
the yield was only
modest (32%) and the analogous reaction with bromine to
obtain 1b failed. Thus, 5-halo-1,2,3-triazoles were prepared via
an alternative route by a copper(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition
between halo-alkynes and azides.14,55−58 For instance, 1a was
obtained using 1,3-bis(iodoethynyl)benzene in moderate yields
(54%) following a previously reported procedure.14 More
importantly, 1,3-bis(bromoethynyl)benzene59 gave 1b in only
one step (Scheme 4b)56 with comparable yields (53%);
however, very long reaction times were required.
To enhance the C−H/C−X bond polarization and to
increase anion aﬃnity via additional Coulomb interactions with
the anions, the 1,2,3-triazoles can be alkylated (e.g., using
trimethyloxonium tetraﬂuoroborate),21,53,60 which is exempli-
ﬁed for 2a (Scheme 4a).29 However, as halogen installation at
the 1,2,3-triazole precursor is less eﬃcient (vide supra), we
were also interested in developing a more general approach
toward halo-1,2,3-triazoliums. Accordingly, we anticipated that
silver(I)-1,2,3-triazolylidenes, which can be prepared conven-
iently by metalation of 1,2,3-triazoliums using Ag2O,29,61−63
might be converted to the corresponding halo-1,2,3-triazoliums
with diﬀerent halogens. Indeed, driven by precipitation of the
corresponding silver(I)-halides, 5-iodo- (3a) and 5-bromo-
1,2,3-triazoliums (2b and 3b) were obtained in very good yields
(86−93%) after treatment of the silver(I)-carbene complex
with iodine or bromine (Scheme 5).

To ensure the uniformity of the counterion for subsequent
binding studies, the product was repeatedly washed with an
aqueous ammonium tetraﬂuoroborate solution, and the identity
and purity of the product was conﬁrmed by NMR, MS, and
elemental analysis. Importantly, this improved route enables the
facile synthesis of 1,2,3-triazoliums via CuAAC and subsequent
methylation as well as the eﬃcient introduction of iodine and
even bromine at the ﬁnal stage.

For comparison, receptors based on the 1,2,4-triazolium
fragment as polarizing group E were also synthesized. The
hydrogen-bond reference system 4 was obtained following a
literature procedure64,65 and subsequent counterion exchange.

deprotonation in the 5-position was proven by 1H NMR
spectroscopy. However, after treatment of the silver(I)-complex
with iodine as described above, the 5-iodo-1,2,4-triazolium

copy and single-crystal X-ray diﬀraction, only the hydrogen-
bond system 4 and a mesoionic 1,2,4-triazolium-5-oxide66
(Figure S57a, Supporting Information (SI)) were obtained. On
the other hand, when using bromine, a partially decomposed
product could be isolated and characterized crystallographically

(Figure S57b, SI). Although the quality of the single crystals
was too low to discuss structural parameters, a C−Br···Br−
halogen bond involving one of the 1,2,4-triazolium moieties
was unambiguously conﬁrmed. Seemingly, the C−X polar-
ization in the case of the 1,2,4-triazolium fragment is too high,
resulting in C−I cleavage upon halogen bond formation
(similar to N-iodosuccinimide).6,67 In contrast, the C−Br bond
is less polarized and thus less reactive.

Note that the 1,2,4-triazolium receptor was benzyl-function-
alized for synthetic ease64 and, to ensure comparability between
the 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-triazolium-based systems, a benzyl-
functionalized 1,2,3-triazolium reference system 5 was synthe-
sized as well.68,69

Crystal Structures. Single crystals of several receptors
could be grown by slow vapor diﬀusion of diﬀerent nonsolvents
into a concentrated solution (Figure 1). In all cases,
the
intended binding site is readily accessible for anions as the
mesityl groups (R′) are arranged orthogonally to the 1,2,3-
triazoles. Additionally, this twisted structure inhibits intermo-
lecular π-stacking thereby increasing the solubility of
the
receptors.

Initial attempts to crystallize 2b (Figure 1a) prior to anion
exchange (vide supra) revealed a 2:1 complex with bromide,
which is ascribed to an excess of the receptor with respect to
the anion. Two receptors form four nearly linear halogen bonds
(167−172°) with a single bromide, which is coordinated in a
distorted tetrahedral fashion. To enable this highly directed
interaction in a bis-bidentate fashion, the triazolium rings twist
out of the plane of the central phenyl ring by 59°. The
measured halogen bond lengths range from 3.14 to 3.27 Å,
which is signiﬁcantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals
radii (3.70 Å)70 and comparable to related complexes.9,71,72
In the case of 1a (Figure 1b), a dimer formed by two nearly
linear halogen bonds (173°−174°) between the iodines and
two diﬀerent nitrogen atoms of a single triazole ring could be
observed. This clearly demonstrates already that the uncharged
iodo-1,2,3-triazole exhibits C−I bond polarization suitable for
halogen bond formation.55 In contrast,
the corresponding
bromo-substituted receptor 1b does not show any halogen

bond interactions in the solid state (see Figure S58, SI), which
is ascribed to the lower polarizability of the halogen bond-
donor atom. Furthermore, the triazoles and the central phenyl
ring adopt a smaller dihedral angle (30°), which is attributed to
the absence of sterically demanding 1,2,3-triazolium methyl
groups and binding toward two contiguous nitrogen atoms.

Figure 1c shows two individual monodentate halogen bonds
with the two counterions in the case of 3b, which is presumably
the result of electronic and steric repulsion between the sulfur
and the halogen atoms. Additionally, anion−π interactions
involving the 1,2,3-triazoliums are observed in the solid state.
Furthermore, single crystals of a sulfate complex were grown
by carefully layering concentrated acetonitrile solutions of 2a
and (NBu4)2SO4 (Figure 2). X-ray diﬀraction reveals bidentate

complexation of a single sulfate anion via two diﬀerent oxygen
atoms in the solid state. Notably, a boronic acid molecule also
binds to the sulfate, which is presumably formed by hydrolysis
of the original tetraﬂuoroborate counterions of 2a (see Figure
S60, SI). As a result, diﬀerent C−I···O bond lengths of 2.80 and
2.60 Å were observed.72 Both halogen bonds are close to
linearity and are signiﬁcantly shorter than the sum of the van
der Waals radii (3.50 Å).70 Aside from a very recently published
catenane−sulfate complex,26 this is the only crystallographic

report of a halogen bond-based sulfate complex reported to
date. Although the boronic acid adduct as well as packing
eﬀects may in principle lead to a preference for this binding
mode, bidentate halogen bonding with two diﬀerent oxygen
atoms of the sulfate is also the preferential complexation mode
according to DFT modeling (see Figure S64, SI).

were performed to quantify the inﬂuence of
the various
receptor components (E, R, and X). Because the formed
complexes precipitated during the NMR titration in MeCN, the
NMR studies had to be performed with a more competitive
solvent (DMSO). In contrast, due to the lower concentrations
required for ITC studies, no solubility issues were encountered
in MeCN, whereas no heat eﬀect was observed in DMSO.34
Evaluation of the NMR titration data was accomplished with
the help of WinEQNMR2 software.73 Because the mesityl
moiety is present in most of the receptors and the proton
resonances of the central phenyl spacer overlap in some cases
(see Figure S39, SI), the H-3,5mes shift migration was used for
determining the binding constants.

NMR Studies. The phenyl-based iodo-1,2,3-triazolium
system 2a was selected as a reference. In Figure 3 (top), a

typical chemical-shift migration obtained by the titration of 2a
with a tetra-n-butylammonium (Bu4N+) halide is depicted.
Upon titration, a downﬁeld shift of the H-2ph signal and a less
pronounced highﬁeld shift for the H-3,5mes signal is observed
with the latter being ascribed to anion−π interactions.74 In line
with the maximum at 0.5 in the corresponding Job plot (see
Figure S33, SI), evaluation of the binding isotherm75 suggests
the predominant formation of a 1:1 complex accompanied by
the formation of a weak 1:2 host−guest complex (Table 1).

strongly suggest a preferential bidentate binding mode. The
assumption of a 1:2 complex is required to explain the minor
chemical-shift perturbations upon the addition of 10−100
equiv, which implies that the second complexation step only
becomes relevant if an excess of guest is provided (see the
speciation curve in Figure 3, bottom). The trend for the K1
values (Table 1) shows a general preference for more charge-
dense/basic halides as the bond acceptor (Cl− > Br− > I−),
which allows for a stronger electrostatic as well as charge-
transfer interaction. Nevertheless,
the soft halides are also
strongly bound, which is tentatively assigned to a larger
covalent contribution toward the halogen bond interactions
compared to that of the analogous hydrogen bond systems.29,33
In comparison to the halides, the complexation of acetate,
dihydrogen phosphate, and sulfate is much stronger, which was
also found previously in analogous studies43 and is rationalized
by the higher basicity of the selected oxo-anions. The observed
slight preference for dihydrogen phosphate over acetate is
contrary to the higher charge density and basicity of acetate and
is thus ascribed to a better ﬁt between the receptor’s cavity and
the tetrahedral anion. The observation of the highest anion
aﬃnity in the case of sulfate is rationalized by its doubly
negative charge, which provides a signiﬁcantly enhanced charge
assistance.29,53,76

In comparison with the iodo-1,2,3-triazolium receptor 2a, the
bromo analogue 2b revealed a signiﬁcantly lower halide aﬃnity
(Table 1) in line with the lower polarizability of the bromine
atom. Like 2a, the NMR data shows a preference of 2b for
more charge-dense halides (Cl− > Br− > I−).

Dependence of the interaction strength on the electron-
withdrawing group is also apparent from Table 1. Although the
individual contributions of charge assistance and increased
polarization cannot be distinguished, comparison of triazole-

and a triazolium-containing receptors (1a vs 2a) clearly
demonstrates the superior chloride aﬃnity of
the iodo-
triazolium system. As the chloride aﬃnity of 1a is already at
the lower limit of detectable interactions, NMR titrations with
bromide and iodide as well as binding studies for receptor 1b
were omitted.

As halogen introduction for 1,2,4-triazoliums failed (vide
supra),
the electron-withdrawing character was studied by
comparing the benzyl-equipped 1,2,4- and 1,2,3-triazolium-
based hydrogen bond donors 4 and 5. According to the
signiﬁcantly higher chloride aﬃnity of 4 (Table 1), the electron-
withdrawing character of the 1,2,4-triazolium moiety is superior
to that of 1,2,3-triazolium (vide infra).29 Additionally, a
comparison between the 1,2,3-triazolium receptors 2 and 5
showed a marginally lower anion aﬃnity in the case of the latter
(Table 1), which is
in line with the weaker electron-
withdrawing character of the benzyl substituent relative to
that of an aryl group.29

Finally, the bidentate halo-1,2,3-triazolium receptors featur-
ing phenyl and thienyl spacers were compared. Relative to 2a,
the halide aﬃnity of 3a is signiﬁcantly lower, although the same
halide preference (Cl− > Br− > I−) was observed. The
combination of bromo-1,2,3-triazolium and a thienyl spacer
(3b) leads to even weaker chloride binding than that of both 3a
and 2b (Table 1), and thus titrations with bromide and iodide
were omitted. The lower halide aﬃnity of the thiophene-based
receptors is ascribed to a weakened bidentate complexation
caused by a more acute bite angle (vide infra).

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry Studies. To gain
insights from an independent experimental technique and to
understand the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the
binding event, ITC measurements were performed for selected
anion−receptor combinations.

As seen in the NMR titration experiments, a binding
preference of 2a for more charge-dense halides (Cl− > Br− >
I−) was observed (Table 2). While the enthalpic contribution
decreases from iodide to bromide to chloride, the entropic
term, and as a net result the binding aﬃnity, increases. Thus,
the complexation appears to be driven by the liberation of
solvent molecules for the smaller halides.77,78 Notably, in the
case of bromide and particularly for chloride, a signiﬁcant
amount of heat is still released after the addition of one equiv of
halide, which requires the use of a TwoSites model
for
evaluation of the titration data (i.e., two complexation sites have
to be taken into account) (Figure 4).79 The stronger process
≈ 105 M−1) is ascribed to the formation of a bidentate
(K1
halogen bond with the anion, whereas the weaker process (K2
≈ 103 M−1) is tentatively assigned to monodentate halogen
≈ 1)
bonding. For both steps, a 1:1 stoichiometry (N1
is observed. In the case of iodide, the analysis was conducted
with both models to ensure comparability; however,
the
OneSites model enables determination of
the association
constants with smaller errors (see Figures S52 and S53, SI).
The bidentate complexation mode appears to be predominant
for the larger iodide.

≈ 1, N2

For bromo-substituted receptor 2b, the OneSites model (see
Figure S55, SI) is applicable and reveals a signiﬁcantly weaker
complexation. In line with the lower polarizability of the C−Br
bond, this process is assigned to the formation of a bidentate
halogen bond, whereas monodentate complexation is presum-
ably too weak to be detected in this case. For hydrogen bond-
based reference system 2, no heat eﬀect can be observed in the
ITC measurement even at very high concentrations of host and
guest.

The titration curve of thienyl-based system 3a was ﬁtted
using the OneSites model (see Figure S56, SI). Considering the
association constants found for 2a and chloride, the complex-
ation is interpreted as the formation of a monodentate halogen
bond, which is plausible given that the two E−X bonds of 3a
are nearly parallel in the solid state (see Figures 1 and 5). The
stoichiometry factor between one and two (N = 1.42) indicates
that both a 1:1 and a 1:2 complex are formed.34
Comparison of the chloride aﬃnity of 2a and 2b with that of
the corresponding imidazolium-based analogues (K1 = 5.20 ×
105 M−1)34 reveals a slightly lower halogen bond donor

strength for
the 1,2,3-triazolium-based receptor, which is
expected because fewer nitrogen atoms are positioned adjacent
to the C−X bond (vide infra).29

DFT Calculations. The binding mode of

the chloride
complexes of 2a and 3a were investigated by quantum chemical
calculations using density functional theory (DFT). As shown
in Figure 5, the thienyl-based system exhibits a more acute bite
angle (α), which precludes the formation of two short, linear
halogen bonds with a single anion. As a consequence, a
monodentate halogen bond with chloride is more stable, which
enables the establishment of a second halogen bond (see the
experimentally determined N value of 1.42, Table 2).
Consistently, the association constants observed in the NMR
and ITC studies for the thienyl-based hosts are lower than
those in the phenyl-based systems. Prospectively, eﬀective
bidentate binding of
larger, polyatomic anions might be
achieved with 3a.
To better understand the electronic inﬂuence of the electron-
withdrawing group E on the C−X bond, DFT calculations were
performed for related N-heterocyclic model systems (Figure 6).
First, the positive charge induces a shift to a more positive
electrostatic potential for the whole receptor, including the σ
hole. Second, when comparing the iodo- and bromo-substituted
receptors, a larger σ hole area is clearly visible in the receptor
with the iodine atom, which is the result of enhanced E−X
polarization. Consistently,
lower anion aﬃnities have been
found experimentally for the bromo-substituted receptors (2b
and 3b). Furthermore, the DFT calculations show that the σ
hole of halo-1,2,3-triazolium and halo-imidazolium are
comparable, whereas the σ hole of the halo-1,2,4-triazolium is
signiﬁcantly larger (Figure 6). On the basis of the CH-acidities
of 1,2,3-triazolium,
imidazolium, and 1,2,4-triazolium (pKa =
24, 20−23, and 17−19, respectively),29 it is obvious that C−X
polarization increases with increasing nitrogen number and is
particularly strong if the nitrogen atoms are placed adjacent to
the C−X bond. Consequently,
the halogen bond donor
strength is expected to adopt the order halo-1,2,3-triazolium
< halo-imidazolium < halo-1,2,4-triazolium. In agreement with
this ordering, the imidazolium-based receptors exhibit anion
aﬃnities that are slightly enhanced compared to those of their
1,2,3-triazolium counterparts. The observed instability of the
halo-1,2,4-triazolium salts (vide supra) can be rationalized by
the excessive polarization of the C−X bond,
leading to a
substantial population of the σ*(E−X) orbital upon halogen
bond formation and, thereby, to destabilization of the E−X
bond.80−82
■ CONCLUSION

A series of bidentate anion receptors based on halo-1,2,3-
triazoliums featuring a 1,3-phenylene spacer was studied
comprehensively by making use of
two experimental
techniques, namely, NMR spectroscopy and ITC titration
experiments. The new receptors were readily synthesized via
copper(I)-catalyzed azide−alkyne click chemistry, methylation,
and formation of a silver(I) precursor. The latter was eﬃciently
converted to the ﬁnal halo-1,2,3-triazoliums by treatment with
the corresponding halogens. The inﬂuence of diﬀerent
parameters on the anion aﬃnities was
investigated by
comparison with selected reference systems. For a better
understanding of the anion binding modes, several anion−
receptor complexes were characterized by X-ray diﬀraction and
modeled by means of DFT calculations. The following
conclusions can be drawn from the collected data: (1) For

the iodo-1,2,3-triazolium-based receptor, which revealed the
highest binding strength, the anion aﬃnity increases in the
order I− < Br− < Cl− < AcO− < H2PO4
2−. (2) When
comparing analogous hydrogen bond- and halogen bond-based
receptors, the latter shows a signiﬁcantly higher association
constant, which in turn is higher for iodine than for bromine as
the bond donor atom. (3) The charge assistance and higher C−
X polarization in the case of halo-1,2,3-triazolium-based
receptors lead to a signiﬁcantly higher anion aﬃnity than for
their halo-1,2,3-triazole counterparts. (4) The position of the
nitrogen atoms within the triazolium ring substantially
inﬂuences hydrogen/halogen bond donation. Relative to
1,2,3-triazoliums,
the hydrogen bond strength for 1,2,4-
triazolium-based receptors is higher. Unfortunately, the halo-
1,2,4-triazolium analogues could not be isolated due to
excessive C−X polarization. (5) Because of the strict linearity
of the halogen bond angle, the utilized spacer unit exerts a
pivotal inﬂuence on the binding mode, leading to a preference
for monodentate halogen bonding for a thienyl spacer, which is
in contrast to the favored bidentate conﬁguration in the case of
the phenyl bridge.

We believe that

these conclusions provide essential
information for the design of anion receptors based on N-
heterocyclic halogen bond donors and will aid in the
exploitation of
their potential
in anion sensing, anion
templation, and organo-catalysis.

purchased from commercially available sources and used as obtained
unless otherwise speciﬁed. Mesityl azide,83 2,5-diethynylthiophene,84

phenylene)bis(1-benzyl-3-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-3-ium) tetraﬂuoro-
borate,69 and silver(I)-oxide86 were prepared according to literature

procedures. Silver(I)-oxide was stored in a desiccator in the dark.
Tetrahydrofuran (THF) was dried and degassed with the help of a
solvent puriﬁcation system and kept under nitrogen using standard
Schlenk techniques. CH2Cl2 was dried by reﬂuxing over calcium
hydride and subsequent distillation under nitrogen. Ammonium
tetraﬂuoroborate for the anion exchange was purchased in 99.999%
purity. Most of the tetra-n-butylammonium anion salts for NMR and
ITC analyses were ordered in high purity (>99%, (Bu4N)AcO > 97%),
whereas (Bu4N)2SO4 was prepared from tetra-n-butylammonium
hydroxide and sulfuric acid and stored in a desiccator in vacuo.
MeCN and DMSO for ITC measurements were purchased in >99%
purity (spectroscopic grade). NMR spectra were measured on
spectrometer at 250, 300, 400, or 600 MHz in deuterated solvents
at 25 °C. Chemical shifts were reported in ppm by using the solvent as
an internal standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-
of-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra (MS) were obtained using a
TOF/TOF mass spectrometer with dithranol as the matrix. All spectra
were measured in the positive-reﬂector mode using a Nd:YAG laser
and a collision cell. Electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS spectra were
measured on an ESI-(Q)-TOF-MS mass spectrometer equipped with
an automatic syringe pump for
sample injection. The mass
spectrometer was operating in the positive-ion mode and the standard
ESI source was used to generate the ions. Binding constants were
obtained using WinEQNMR273 software in the case of NMR analysis
and a MicroCal Origin 7.0-based software package in the case of ITC
studies.

Computational Details. All calculations were performed with the
Gaussian 09 (G09) program package87 employing the DFT method
using the M06-2X functional.88 The iodine atom was treated by the
46-electron relativistic eﬀective core potential MWB89 for the inner
shells, whereas the outer shells (i.e., 4s, 4p, 4d, and 5s electrons) were
treated separately. The remaining atoms (i.e., C, H, N, and S) were
treated with a basis set of quadruple-ζ valence quality.90 The bulk
solvent eﬀects (MeCN) were included using the integral equation
formalism of the polarizable continuum model by Tomasi and co-
workers.91 Geometry optimizations were performed without any
constraints, and the true nature was conﬁrmed by normal-mode
analysis. Visualization of the electrostatic potential was performed
using the GaussView 5.0 package.92

Crystal Structure Determination. The intensity data for the
compounds were collected on a Nonius Kappa CCD diﬀractometer,
using graphite-monochromated Mo Kα radiation. Data were corrected
for Lorentz and polarization eﬀects; absorption was taken into account
on a semiempirical basis using multiple scans.93−95 The structures
were solved by direct methods (SHELXS96) and reﬁned by full-matrix
least-squares techniques against Fo2 (SHELXL-9796). The hydrogen
atoms bound to the compounds 1b, 2a·SO4, and 1,2,4-triazolium-5-
oxide were located by diﬀerence Fourier synthesis and reﬁned
isotropically. All other hydrogen atoms were included at calculated
positions with ﬁxed thermal parameters. All non-hydrogen atoms were
reﬁned anisotropically.96 The crystal of 1a contains large voids that
were ﬁlled with disordered solvent molecules. The size of the voids are
249 Å3/unit cell. Their contribution to the structure factors was
secured by back-Fourier transformation using the SQUEEZE routine
of the program PLATON97 resulting in 32 electrons/unit cell. The
crystals of 5-bromo-1,2,4-triazolium were extremely thin and of low
quality, resulting in a substandard data set; however, the structure is
suﬃcient to show connectivity and geometry despite the high ﬁnal R
value. We will only publish the conformation of the molecule and the
crystallographic data but will not deposit the data in the Cambridge
Crystallographic Data Centre. Crystallographic data as well as
structure solution and reﬁnement details are summarized in Tables
S2 and S3 in the SI. MERCURY-3.3 was used for structure
representations.

Synthetic Procedures. General Procedure (A) for the CuAAC
Reaction (Adopted from ref 98). A 250 mL round-bottom ﬂask was
charged with an ethanol/water/CH2Cl2 (2:1:1) mixture (100 mL) and
purged with nitrogen. Successively, mesityl azide (2.4 equiv) or benzyl
azide (3.0 equiv), copper(II) sulfate (0.2 equiv) dissolved in water (1
mL), sodium ascorbate (2 equiv) dissolved in water (6 mL), and 1,3-
diethynylbenzene (1 equiv) or 2,5-diethynylthiophene (1 equiv) were
added. Under the exclusion of light, the reaction mixture was stirred at
50 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere overnight, whereupon a
precipitate was formed. After complete conversion was conﬁrmed by
TLC, 40 drops of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid
(HEEDTA) were added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 30
min at 50 °C. After cooling to room temperature, water (150 mL) was
added, and the reaction mixture was extracted three times with
CH2Cl2. The combined organic phases were washed with water, dried
over sodium sulfate, ﬁltered, and concentrated in vacuo. After
precipitation by dropping the concentrated CH2Cl2 solution into n-
pentane, washing with n-pentane, and drying in vacuo, the product was
obtained as a white or yellow solid.

General Procedure (B) for Methylation with Meerwein’s Salt
(Adopted from refs 21 and 99). A Schlenk ﬂask was loaded with a bis-
triazole derivative educt (1 equiv) dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (20 mL)
and Meerwein’s salt (trimethyloxonium tetraﬂuoroborate, 2.2 equiv),
and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature under a
nitrogen atmosphere until TLC-monitoring indicated full conversion
of the educt (silica, CH2Cl2/MeOH (95:5)). After adding MeOH (2
mL) to quench excessive oxonium salt, the turbid reaction mixture
became clear and was evaporated to dryness. The residue was
dissolved in acetone or MeCN and precipitated by dropping the
concentrated solution into diethyl ether. The precipitate was washed
with diethyl ether and dried to yield the desired product.

General Procedure (C) for Synthesis of the Silver(I) Precursors
(Adopted from ref 99). A Schlenk ﬂask was charged with a bis-
triazolium derivative educt (1 equiv), desiccator-dried Ag2O (3 equiv),
and activated 3 Å molecular sieves.100 Dry and degassed MeCN (20
mL) was added in the counterﬂow of nitrogen, and the reaction
mixture was heated under reﬂux while being excluded from light for 12
h under nitrogen. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was
ﬁltered over Celite with the help of MeCN as eluent. After being
concentrated in vacuo, the crude product was puriﬁed by precipitation
of the MeCN solution into diethyl ether. The resulting precipitate was
ﬁltered, washed with diethyl ether, and dried to yield the product as a
white solid. The product was stored under nitrogen in a Schlenk ﬂask
in the fridge.

General Procedure (D) for the Reaction of the Silver(I) Precursors
with Halogens. A Schlenk ﬂask was loaded with the silver(I) precursor
(1 equiv) dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (10 mL) for the phenyl-based
receptors or in a dry CH2Cl2/MeCN (1:1) mixture for the thienyl-
based receptors. Under the exclusion of light, the halogen (2.2 equiv)
was added dropwise at 0 °C. Therefore, the amount of iodine was
directly dissolved in dry and previously degassed MeCN (2 mL). In
the case of bromine, a 0.66 M stock solution in dry CH2Cl2 was
prepared. After addition of the halogen, the reaction mixture was kept
stirring at 0 °C for 30 min and then for 1 h at room temperature. The
resulting suspension was dropped into diethyl ether to remove the
excessive halogen, and the residue was ﬁltered and washed with diethyl
ether. After rinsing with MeCN and concentration of the ﬁltrate in
vacuo, the mixture was ﬁltered over Celite with the help of MeCN as
eluent to remove the remaining silver salt. The clear solution was
evaporated to dryness;
the resulting residue was dissolved in a
CH2Cl2/MeOH (9:1) mixture and extracted ﬁve times with a 1 M
aqueous ammonium tetraﬂuoroborate solution and two times with
water (for a related anion exchange, see ref 101). After complete
removal of the solvent in vacuo, the desired product was isolated and
further puriﬁed by crystallization through vapor diﬀusion of diethyl
ether into a concentrated solution of the product.

1,3-Bis(1-mesityl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)benzene (1). Following gen-
eral procedure A, mesityl azide (2.80 g, 17.4 mmol), copper(II) sulfate

commercially available 1,3-diethynylbenzene (907 mg, 955 μL, 7.2
mmol) were allowed to react for 5 h at 50 °C and for 40 h at room
temperature to yield desired product 1 as a white solid (3.08 g, 96%).

1,3-Bis(5-iodo-1-mesityl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)benzene (1a)
(Adopted from refs 54 and 102). The reaction was carried out in
a two-neck Schlenk ﬂask. The ﬂask was equipped with an internal
thermometer, and 1 (896 mg, 2.0 mmol) was added and dissolved in
dry THF (18 mL). n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane, 1.92 mL, 4.8 mmol, 2.4
equiv) was added dropwise over 30 min at approximately −78 °C; the
solution changed color from yellow to dark red. After additional 10
min at −78 °C, iodine (1.32 g, 5.2 mmol, 2.6 equiv) dissolved in dry
THF (5 mL) was added dropwise. The temperature was raised to
room temperature within 1 h, and the mixture was stirred overnight.
The mixture was washed with an aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution
to quench the excess of
iodine. The solution was extracted with
CH2Cl2 and the combined organic layers were washed with water. The
organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and ﬁltered, and the
solvent was removed. The crude product was puriﬁed by column
chromatography (silica, 99:1 CH2Cl2/MeOH) to obtain the desired
product 1a in moderate yield (440 mg, 32%). Single crystals were
obtained by slow vapor diﬀusion of n-pentane into a concentrated
solution of 1a in CH2Cl2. 1H NMR (300 MHz, CD2Cl2): δ 8.83 (s,

An alternative route is a copper(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition between
1,3-bis(iodoethynyl)benzene14 and mesityl azide. A Schlenk ﬂask was
loaded with copper(I) iodide (115 mg, 0.60 mmol) and tris-
(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine (TBTA, 319 mg, 0.60 mmol) dissolved
in dry THF (20 mL). This mixture was stirred for 3 h at room
temperature and was then added to 1,3-bis(iodoethynyl)benzene (350
mg, 0.93 mmol) dissolved in 1 mL of dry THF. Subsequently, the
mesityl azide (328 mg, 2.04 mmol) dissolved in 1 mL of dry THF was
added slowly. The reaction mixture was stirred for 6 days at room
temperature in the dark. 3 mL of 10% NH4OH solution were added to

added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C under nitrogen and
TLC monitoring for a total of 2 weeks with additional dry THF added
intermittently. Then, water was added and the solution was extracted
three times with CH2Cl2. The combined organic layers were washed
with an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, brine, and twice
with water. After removal of the solvent, the crude product was
puriﬁed by column chromatography (silica, CH2Cl2) to obtain desired

constants because these signals are present in both phenyl- and
thienyl-containing receptors and because the proton resonances for
the central phenyl ring overlapped in the oxo-anion binding studies.
Note that the analysis based on the chemical shifts of the triazolium
protons (H-5trz, see Table 1) and the protons of the triazolium’s
methyl group (CH3-3trz) gave very similar results.
