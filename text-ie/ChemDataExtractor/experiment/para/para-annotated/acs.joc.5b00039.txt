ABSTRACT: A highly chemoselective synthesis of β-keto-
phosphonates from pentaﬂuorophenyl esters and lithiated methyl
α-(trimethylsilyl)methylphosphonate has been developed. This
mild lithiated phosphonate reagent allows the synthesis of
functionalized β-ketophosphonates in the presence of unactivated
esters with high yields. This method has been compared with the
standard lithiated methylphosphonate reagent.

T he Horner−Wadsworth−Emmons (HWE) reaction1 is a

reliable and eﬃcient method to synthesize α,β-unsatu-
rated ketones, which is often used in total synthesis as a key
step to construct E-oleﬁns
from functionalized reaction
partners.2 This highly stereoselective transformation requires
β-ketophosphonates as precursors, making them a strategic
class of compounds. The synthesis of β-ketophosphonates is
generally realized according to two synthetic routes:
the
Michaelis−Arbuzov reaction3 of an α-haloketone with a
phosphite (Scheme 1, eq 1) or the addition of a lithiated
methylphosphonate to esters, in order to directly access the
β‑ketophosphonates,2c,d or aldehydes followed by oxidation of
the resulting alcohols (Scheme 1, eq 2).2e,f The requirement of
an α-haloketone for the Arbuzov reaction and the competitive
Perkov reaction makes this strategy less attractive than the
condensation of lithiated methylphosphonates, particularly in
the case of elaborated substrates. Although this latter method is
usually preferred, several equivalents of lithiated methylphos-
phonate are often required to produce β-ketophosphonates in
good yields. This is notably due to the latent instability of
lithiated methylphosphonate toward self-condensation4 or alkyl
transfer, which could be limited by the order of addition of the
reagents used for their generation.5 Several other methods have
also been developed to access β-ketophosphonates such as the
Claisen condensation of several metalated methylphosphonates
including copper,6 cerium,7 cobalt or magnesium derivatives,8
practical procedures
the lithiated
methylphosphonate reagent,9 addition of the magnesium salt
of diethyl phosphonoacetic acid to acid chlorides,10 oxy-
phosphorylation of alkenes under oxidative conditions,11 or
addition of diazomethylphosphonates to aldehydes mediated by
tin(II) chloride.12 Besides the latter method, known as the
Roskamp reaction which was very elegantly used on an
advanced synthetic intermediate in a recent total synthesis of
norhalichondrin B,13 most of the other procedures either lead
to low to moderate yields or have a limited range of
applications.

Herein, we report an eﬃcient and chemoselective method for
the generation of β-ketophosphonates based on the Claisen
the lithiated α-(trimethylsilyl)methylphos-
condensation of
phonate with activated esters (Scheme 1, eq 3). By taking
the silicon14 and the steric
advantage of
hindrance of the trimethylsilyl group, the reactivity of such
phosphonate reagents could be modulated, thereby increasing
the chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance in the
substrates. α-(Trialkylsilyl)phosphonates have been extensively
studied by Savignac et al.15 and are mainly used as precursors of
vinylphosphonates through the Peterson oleﬁnation.16 How-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, only two reports were
dealing with the use of those reagents for the synthesis of
α‑substituted β‑ketophosphonates.17,18 In one report,

1‑(trimethylsilyl)vinylphosphonate was achieved, and the
resulting lithiated phosphonate intermediate was trapped with
acyl chlorides to generate α-alkyl-β-ketophosphonates in good
yields. However, only unfunctionalized organolithium reagents
and acyl chlorides were used as partners.17 The second report is
dealing with α-(trimethylsilyl)methylphosphonate 1, which
produces β-ketophosphonates with acyl ﬂuorides as inter-
mediates for the HWE reaction.18

Table 1. Screening of Acyl Activating Groupsa

aReaction conditions: n-BuLi (0.66 mmol) was added to phosphonate
1 (0.69 mmol) in THF (1.5 mL) at −78 °C, and benzoic acid
derivatives 3 (0.3 mmol) in THF (1.5 mL) were added after 30 min at
the indicated temperature. bIsolated yields.
<para sub=“opt”>
Our investigations started with the study of the reactivity of
the lithiated α-(trimethylsilyl)methylphosphonate 2 (Table 1).
This latter reagent was generated from α-(trimethylsilyl)meth-
ylphosphonate 1 by treatment with n-BuLi and then involved in
a Claisen condensation with benzoic acid derivatives 3. The
electrophilic character of these derivatives was modulated by
several classical acyl activating groups. When methyl ester 3a
was reacted with lithiated α-(trimethylsilyl)methylphosphonate
2, no reaction occurred at −78 °C (Table 1, entry 1); however,
raising the temperature to −40 or −20 °C aﬀorded
β‑ketophosphonate 4 in 39% and 78% yield, respectively
(Table 1, entries 2 and 3). It is also worth mentionning that
β‑ketophosphonate 4 was directly obtained after an aqueous
workup with a saturated solution of ammonium chloride and
the α-trimethylsilyl-β-ketophosphonate
that no traces of
intermediate were observed. The lability of the trimethylsilyl
group after the condensation was of interest as this avoids an

additional desilylation step to isolate the desired β-ketophosph-
onate. With a phenyl ester such as 3b (Table 1, entry 4), a low
conversion was noticed at −78 °C, suggesting that β‑ketophos-
phonates could be obtained at that temperature if a better
leaving group was used. To our delight, very high yields of
β‑ketophosphonate 4 were obtained at −78 °C with classical
activated acyl donors derived from imidazole, p-nitrophenol,
and pentaﬂuorophenol (Table 1, entries 5 to 7). As the
pentaﬂuorophenyl ester 3e led to a complete conversion and a
quantitative yield of β‑ketophosphonate 4, this activating group
was selected to generalize the reaction (Table 1, entry 7).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
The substrate scope was evaluated with various pentaﬂuoro-
phenyl esters 5, and the results are summarized in Table 2.
These esters were easily prepared by a coupling reaction of the
corresponding acid and the commercialy available pentaﬂuoro-
phenol mediated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or N-(3-
(dimethylamino)propyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride
(EDCI). A control experiment was systematically performed
with lithiated methylphosphonate 7 to assess the beneﬁt of
using the silylated phosphonate reagent 2 with activated esters.
The amount of lithiated phosphonate reagent was set to 2.2
equiv, as one equivalent is directly consumed by deprotonation
of the generated β-ketophosphonate. As shown in the previous
screening of the acyl activating groups (Table 1), methyl ester
5a and benzyl ester 5b appeared to be fully compatible with
reagent 2 at −78 °C, as well as methyl benzoates 5c, 5d and
the corresponding β‑ketophos-
lactone 5e. High yields of
phonates 6a−6e were obtained. The use of lithiated methyl-
phosphonate 7 with these substrates led to much lower yields
due to incomplete conversion and formation of several
unidentiﬁed byproducts (Table 2, entries 1−5). Similarly, the
condensation of reagent 2 also occurred chemoselectively for
substrates possessing an acetate or a benzoate (Table 2, entries
6−7). Not surprisingly, there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between the lithiated phosphonates 2 and 7 for substrates
bearing an epoxide (5h), a bromine (5i), or an alkyne (5j)
(Table 2, entries 8−10). Since the formation of β‑ketophosph-
onates from β-alkoxy esters could be diﬃcult, considering the
competitive β-elimination,19 the less basic silyl phosphonate
reagent 2 was tested with activated esters 5k and 5l. However,
only a minor yield improvement was obtained with reagent 2 in
comparison with lithium methylphosphonate 7 (Table 2,
entries 11−12). One remarkable illustration of the chemo-
selectivity of lithiated phosphonate 2 is the reaction involving
the functionalized sugar derivative 5m. The corresponding
β‑ketophosphonate 6m was obtained in 47% yield, whereas the
reaction with lithiated methylphosphonate 7 gave rise to a
complex mixture of compounds with no traces of 6m (Table 2,
entry 13).

It has been demonstrated that

In summary, we have described an eﬃcient and chemo-
selective route to β-ketophosphonates from various penta-
ﬂuorophenyl esters.
the
combination of these activated esters with the lithiated silyl
phosphonate reagent 2 provides a highly chemoselective
method compatible with substrates containing unactivated
esters. Moreover, these transformations proceed in high yields
and only require a minimum amount of the lithium reagent 2.
This method constitutes an eﬃcient tool for the introduction of
a β-ketophosphonate moiety in polyfunctionalized substrates
that should ﬁnd applications in organic synthesis.
