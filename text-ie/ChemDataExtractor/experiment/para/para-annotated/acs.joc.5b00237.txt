ABSTRACT: An eﬃcient method for synthesizing diﬀerent
functionalized azabicyclo[X.Y.0]alkanone amino acid deriva-
tives has been developed employing electrophilic transannular
cyclizations of 8-, 9-, and 10-membered unsaturated macro-
cycles to form 5,5-, 6,5-, 7,5-, and 6,6-fused bicylic amino
acids, respectively. Macrocycles were obtained by a sequence
featuring peptide coupling of vinyl-, allyl-, homoallyl-, and
followed by ring-
homohomoallylglycine building blocks
closing metathesis. X-ray crystallographic analyses of
the
8-, 9-, and 10-membered macrocyclic lactam starting materials
as well as certain bicyclic amino acid products provided insight
into their conformational preferences as well as the mechanism
for the diastereoselective formation of speciﬁc azabicycloalkanone amino acids by way of transannular iodolactamization
reactions.

■ INTRODUCTION

Azabicyclo[X.Y.0]alkane structures, such as pyrrolizidines,
indolizidines, and qunolizidines, are found in numerous
biologically active alkaloid natural products.1,2 The related
azabicyclo[X.Y.0]alkanone amino acid counterparts are rigid
dipeptide surrogates that have been employed to study
conformation−activity relationships of biologically active pep-
tides.3,4 Inherent to the syntheses of both classes of heterocycles
has been the stereocontrolled construction of the bicyclic ring
system in a way that provides for eﬀective introduction of ring
functionality. Among various synthetic strategies,5 transannular
reactions featuring amine nucleophiles reacting on macrocyclic
oleﬁn and epoxide precursors have exhibited considerable utility
for the stereoselective construction of the bicyclic amines,6,7
albeit few examples of the related cyclizations of macrocyclic
lactams have been reported.8 In both cases, regioselective
formation of speciﬁc bicycles has often been observed to occur
with high diastereoselectivity. Limited mechanistic understand-
ing exists however to predict the outcome of such transannular
cyclization reactions, because they have been typically performed
on a restricted number of ring sizes with substituents that have
varied greatly both in functional group and in location. Generally,
in cycloalkanes of 8−11 ring atoms, unfavorable interactions of
ring substituents can cause signiﬁcant strain, so-called “Prelog
strain”.9,10 Moreover, nitrogen lone pair electrons have been
reported to prefer an antiorientation with respect to the oleﬁn
π-bond to minimize repulsive interactions.11 Such steric and
electronic interactions serve likely in part as driving forces for
preferred macrocycle conformations and favored regioselective
cyclizations.

In the interest of developing a general strategy for synthesizing
azabicyclo[X.Y.0]alkanone amino acids of varying ring sizes, we
have pursued electrophilic transannular lactamizations of unsatu-
rated macrocyclic dipeptides.8a This strategy is appealing, because
a variety of macrocycles may be generated by coupling various
ω-unsaturated amino acids, followed by ring-closing metathesis
(RCM; Figure 1). Moreover, after transannular iodolactamization,
the resulting iodide has served as a handle for introducing various
side chain functional groups onto the bicyclic system.12

Considering that both bicycle and macrocycle constraints
serve to rigidify the peptide backbone,5c,13 eﬀorts have focused
on studying the synthesis and conformational analysis of a series
of ring systems in which the same dipeptide motif is maintained
as the ring size and oleﬁn orientation are modulated. Employing
X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, insight has now
been gained with respect to the conformational preferences of
the macrocyclic and bicyclic dipeptide motifs, as well as the
regioselective nature of the transannular lactamization. Exploring
ﬁve diﬀerent macrocycles, we have found conditions to prepare
regioselectively and stereoselectively ﬁve distinct bicyclic
dipeptide mimics, validating the eﬀectiveness of this approach
for peptidomimetic synthesis.

(Z)-10a was initially studied by treatment with iodine in THF

transannular iodoamidation using I2 in THF buﬀered with

cyclization was achieved by treating (Z)-11a with (diacetoxyiodo)-
benzene (DIB; 1.5 equiv) and 4 equiv of iodine in acetonitrile at

oxidative cyclizations of o-hydroxystyrenes to benzofurans, to the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst use of this reagent in a
transannular iodolactamization. (3R,4R,5S,8S)-Pyrrolizidinone 3

of 3, hypervalent iodine may activate the double bond as a
3-membered iodonium species, 22,26 which undergoes intra-
molecular reaction with the amide nitrogen to form intermediate
23. Displacement of the hypervalent iodine by the neighboring
carbamate may occur by way of an oxazole intermediate 24, which
is opened by iodide to give iodopyrrolizidinone 3 with retention of

Stereochemical Assignment Using NMR Spectroscopy.
The assignment of the structure and stereochemistry of bicycles
3−5 was accomplished by 2D NMR spectroscopy and X-ray
crystallography (Supporting Information). Typically, a COSY
spectrum was used to assign the ring proton through-bond
connectivities starting from the downﬁeld carbamate NH proton.
The observation of magnetization transfer between the peptide
backbone protons and ring protons in the NOESY and ROESY
spectra was then used to assign the relative stereochemistry at the
ring-fusion and iodide-bearing carbons (Figure 2). For example,

Mechanistic Considerations. Transannular iodolactamiza-
tions have been studied using a series of related macrocycles of
8−10 ring atoms. In spite of the structural similarities of the
starting macrocyclic lactams, many factors may inﬂuence this
reaction,
including the ring conformation and cyclization
conditions. In related iodolactamizations, regioselectivity has
previously been considered to be a consequence of the macro-
cycle conformation.37 In this light,
the
macrocycle ring may contribute to mixtures of bicyclic products,
yet ring substituents that orient to avoid allylic strain with the
oleﬁn substituents and diaxial
interactions will signiﬁcantly
reduce the number of cyclization pathways. Typically, a relaxed
conformer may orient the lactam and oleﬁn to give regio- and
stereoselective pathways.37,8f,d In such cases,
the iodide
substituent ends up on the lactam ring. In one case, a thermo-
dynamically less stable 9-membered lactam has been found to
give an alternative regio- and stereochemical
indolizidinone
featuring a 5-membered lactam and a piperidine ring bearing the
iodide.37 In addition, 9-membered lactam (Z)-11e gave imidate 5
instead of a fused 7,4-bicycle with the iodide on the 7-membered
lactam or a 6,5-bicycle with the iodide on the 5-membered
pyrrolidine.
<para sub=“ques”>
Although electrophile-induced intramolecular cyclization
reactions may proceed by formation of a dihalide that
is
subsequently displaced by the lactam to form the ring,8e
cyclizations of macrocycles (Z)-11a, (Z)-11e, and (Z)-10d are
presumed to proceed by way of iodonium-like intermediates
based on their stereochemical outcomes.40 The ambidentate
nucleophilic nature of the amide group has been observed to give
imidates in iodocyclizations of simpler oleﬁns,41,42 and such

disfavored due to the need to avoid allylic strain between the
carboxylate and the lactam carbonyl as well as potential diaxial
interactions between the carboxylate and the iodide. In the case
of 5, the combination of the factors mentioned above and ring
strain to make a 4-membered azetidine lead to a preferred attack
by oxygen, giving the imidate. Computational analyses are
currently being pursued to provide additional support of these
mechanistic considerations.

■ CONCLUSIONS

A variety of azabicyclo[X.Y.0]alkanone amino acids have been
prepared using a common approach featuring eﬀective assembly
of macrocyclic lactams of 8−10-membered ring sizes by the
synthesis and coupling of ω-unsaturated amino acids and RCM
of their dipeptide derivatives, followed by regio- and stereo-
selective electrophilic transannular cyclization. Employing X-ray
crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic analyses, we have
demonstrated that the macrocyclic and bicyclic structures oﬀer
ample potential to mimic peptide secondary structures,
in
particular types I, II′, and VI β-turn geometries contingent on
ring size. Moreover, such conformational analyses have also
provided insight into the mechanism of transannular iodolactam-
ization. Considering the potential of this method for eﬀectively
making a series of related dipeptide mimics to explore peptide
conformation−activity relationships, as well as the opportunity
for replacing the iodide with other side chains to examine
functional group inﬂuences on activity, this method should have
a signiﬁcant impact on peptidomimetic approaches for studying
biologically active peptides, particularly for the discovery of
therapeutic agents.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Methods. Unless otherwise noted, all reactions were
performed under an argon atmosphere and distilled solvents were
transferred by syringe. Anhydrous CH2Cl2 (DCM), THF, and diethyl
ether were obtained by passage through a solvent ﬁltration system.
Final reaction mixture solutions were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 or
Na2SO4, ﬁltered, and rotary-evaporated under reduced pressure.
Flash chromatography46 was on 230−400 mesh silica gel, and thin-
layer chromatography was performed on silica gel 60 F254 plates.
Speciﬁc rotations, [α]D values, were calculated from optical rotations
measured at 20 °C in CHCl3 or MeOD at the speciﬁed concentrations
(c, g/100 mL) using a 1 dm cell (l) on a polarimeter, using the general
20 = 100α/lc. Accurate mass measurements were performed
formula [α]D
on an LC-MSD instrument in electrospray ionization (ESI-TOF)
mode. Sodium adducts [M + Na]+ were used for empirical formula
conﬁrmation. 1H NMR spectra were measured in CDCl3 (7.26 ppm),
CD3OD (3.31 ppm), or DMSO-d6 (2.50 ppm). 13C NMR spectra were
measured in CDCl3 (77.16 ppm) or DMSO-d6 (39.52 ppm). 1H NMR
spectra for the dipeptides 7a, 7b, 6d, 7d, 6g, 11g, 11d, and 20 were
recorded at 100 °C to coalesce signals due to conformational isomers.
Coupling constant J values were measured in hertz and chemical shift
values in parts per million. Infrared spectra were recorded for neat
samples on an FT-IR apparatus. Syntheses and characterization of

compounds 7e, 10e, 11e, 17a, 17b, 16a, and 16b have been previously
reported.14

To a stirred solution of zinc dust (11.92 g, 182.3 mmol, 6 equiv) in
dry DMF (20 mL) was added 1,2-dibromoethane (1.57 mL, 3.42 g,
18.2 mmol, 0.6 equiv) via a syringe. The resulting mixture was heated to
60 °C, stirred for 45 min, and cooled to room temperature, and the
slurry was treated with chlorotrimethylsilane (0.77 mL, 6.0 mmol).
After being stirred for 40 min at room temperature, the activated zinc
was treated with a solution of methyl (R)-N-Boc-iodoalaninate (12;
10 g, 30.39 mmol) in dry DMF (20 mL), heated to 35 °C, and stirred
for 60 min, when insertion was judged complete by TLC analysis
[2:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate, using 254 nm UV light to visualize the
starting material 12 (Rf = 0.7) and organozinc reagent (Rf = 0.1)].
After complete zinc insertion, the reaction mixture was cooled to
room temperature, charged with Pd2(dba)3 (779 mg, 0.85 mmol,
0.028 equiv) and tri-o-tolylphosphine (925 mg, 3.03 mmol, 0.1 equiv),
cooled to −78 °C, and treated dropwise via a cannula with a solution of
vinyl bromide in THF (1 M, 42.5 mL, 42.5 mmol, 1.4 equiv). After
complete addition of the vinyl bromide solution, the cold bath was
removed, and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room
temperature with stirring for 12 h. The reaction mixture was diluted
with ethyl acetate (200 mL) and water (200 mL), and ﬁltered through a
pad of Celite. The pad was washed with ethyl acetate (300 mL). The
ﬁltrate and washings were combined and transferred to a separating
funnel. The organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was
extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers
were washed with brine (400 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium
sulfate, ﬁltered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 8.2 g
of brown oil, which was puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica
gel (8−10% EtOAc in hexane) to give oleﬁn 13 (4.50 g, 19.64 mmol,

the enantiomeric purity of oleﬁn 13, as well as the hydrochloride 30
obtained on treating 13 with HCl gas in dichloromethane, were both
unsuccessful using supercritical ﬂuid chromatography on a chiral
column. To assess enantiomeric purity, diastereomeric amides were
synthesized as described below. The crude residue was examined
by 1H NMR spectroscopy in CD3CN at 700 MHz. Incremental
addition of (S,R)-31 to (S,S)-31 and observation of the methyl ester
singlets at 3.697 and 3.691 ppm demonstrated the diastereomers were
of >99:1 dr. Hence, oleﬁn 13 is assumed to be of >98% enantiomeric
purity.

Dipeptide 7b (200 mg, 0.32 mmol) was dissolved in DCM (400 mL),
treated with the Grubbs ﬁrst-generation catalyst (79 mg, 0.096 mmol),
heated, and stirred at reﬂux for 2 days, when TLC indicated remaining

the mixture, which was heated at reﬂux and stirred for 1 day. The
volatiles were removed under reduced pressure. The residue was taken
up in a minimum volume of DCM, applied onto a silica gel column, and
eluted with 35−40% EtOAc in hexanes. Evaporation of the collected

A stirred solution of Boc-protected dipeptide lactam 9g (200 mg,
0.42 mmol) in 10 mL of DCM was treated with TFA (4 mL) at 0 °C and
stirred for 2 h, and the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure
to provide the triﬂuoroacetate salt, which was dissolved in 15 mL of a
1:1 water/acetone solution and treated with Fmoc-OSu (138 mg,
0.42 mmol) and Na2CO3 (90 mg, 0.84 mmol). After being stirred for
18 h at room temperature, the mixture was diluted with water and
acidiﬁed to pH 3−4 with 10% KHSO4 solution. This aqueous solution
was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL). The combined organic
layers were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, ﬁltered, and
concentrated to a residue that was puriﬁed by chromatography on silica
gel using 25−30% EtOAc in hexane as the eluent. Evaporation of the
collected fractions gave Fmoc-protected dipeptide lactam 10g (151 mg,

In the dark, a solution of macrocycle 11a (100 mg, 0.24 mmol) in
acetonitrile (4 mL) was treated with iodine (243 mg, 0.96 mmol) followed
by (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (116 mg, 0.36 mmol). The resulting mixture
was heated to 80 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature, and
the volatiles were evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was
chromatographed on silica gel (40−50% EtOAc in hexane) to give
pyrrolizidinone 3 (81 mg, 0.15 mmol, 62%) as a light-sensitive white

In the dark, a solution of macrocycle 11e (50 mg, 0.11 mmol) in
acetonitrile (4 mL) was treated with NaHCO3 (27 mg, 0.33 mmol)
followed by iodine (83.7 mg, 0.33 mmol) in three portions, stirred for
1 h at rt, and treated with 1 M Na2S2O3 until the purple solution became
clear. The mixture was extracted quickly with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL).
The organic extractions were washed with brine, dried, and
concentrated under reduced pressure to a residue that was chromato-
graphed on silica gel (20−30% EtOAc in hexane). Evaporation of the
