ABSTRACT: The selective C3-alkylation of indoles with N-
protected ethanolamines involving the “borrowing hydrogen”
strategy is described. This method provides convenient and
sustainable access to several tryptamine derivatives.

■ INTRODUCTION

The tryptamine moiety is found in a number of drugs and is a
common motif in countless naturally occurring compounds that
use L-tryptophan as a biosynthetic precursor.1 The direct and
selective construction of tryptamine derivatives from simple
and sustainable starting materials using a catalytic system
provides convenient access to a range of structurally diverse
natural products, pharmaceutical compounds, potential building
blocks for indole alkaloid chemistry, and other polynitro-
genated compounds.2 Although methods accessing these
bioactive molecules have been reported, there are few one-
step transformations that provide access
to tryptamines.
Classical methods involve the C-3 Friedel−Crafts alkylation
indoles3 with either nitroalkenes4 or aziridines5 as the
of
electrophilic partner, promoted by Lewis acids and/or
organocatalysts. However, due to the toxicity and instability
of these strongly electrophilic reactants6 as well as selectivity
issues during the required extra reduction step of the nitro
group and/or aziridine ring opening, a more sustainable and
eﬃcient method is highly desired.7 In the search for new
suitable two-carbon nitrogen-containing electrophiles, we
recently described the eﬃcient use of N-protected aminoethyl
acetals for the reductive alkylation of indoles,8 giving access to
tryptamine derivatives in a single step. During the course of this
study, we found that acyl protection of the amine side chain
was necessary to achieve acceptable levels of
reactivity.
Although this approach employs safe and inexpensive reagents,
proceeds under mild conditions, and tolerates several functional
groups, the shortcomings associated with completely unsub-
stituted indoles as well as a large excess of the reducing agent
and TFA prompted us to investigate a novel catalytic and less
wasteful method encompassing a wider
indoles
without the need for an external reductant.

The so-called “borrowing hydrogen” methodology (also
named as “hydrogen autotransfer”), in which dehydrogenation
of poorly reactive alcohols is followed by in situ consumption of
the generated hydrogen equivalents, has gained acceptance as
an eﬃcient synthetic strategy in organic synthesis. Seminal
work by Grigg and Watanabe9 as well as extensive studies by
many other groups10 have shown that in the presence of

range of

transition-metal catalysts (usually ruthenium or
iridium
complexes), poorly reactive alcohols are useful electrophilic
partners for N-alkylation and C−C bond formation in which
amines and methylene carbon acids are typically used as
nucleophiles.11 The use of a neutral electron-rich aromatic
system with alcohols in the direct transition-metal-catalyzed
alkylation has also been reported. However, to the best of our
there are no examples using the “borrowing
knowledge,
hydrogen” strategy for the synthesis of tryptamine derivatives,
despite the synthetic advantages of such an approach.12 Herein,
we report the development of an eﬀective protocol for the
direct
indoles with N-protected
ethanolamines to aﬀord tryptamine derivatives. This strategy
could open attractive possibilities for the total synthesis of
tryptamine-based alkaloids.

Ir-catalyzed alkylation of

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
Preliminary studies were carried out at 150 °C in a sealed tube,
using commercially available N-acetylethanolamine (2a) and
unsubstituted indole (1a) in the presence of substoichiometric
amounts of KOH (20%). A variety of transition-metal catalysts
well-known to be highly active in hydrogen autotransfer
including Pd/C, RuCl2(PPh3)3, [Ir(cod)Cl]2, [Ir-
reactions,
(coe)2Cl]2, [Ir(OMe)(cod)]2, and RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3, were
screened. We found that the iridium dimer [Cp*IrCl2]2
13 was
the most eﬃcient catalyst. After 48 h, we observed complete
consumption of the indole and selective formation of the
desired N-acetyltryptamine (35% yield; Table 1, entry 9),
without traces of the N1-alkylated product. The discrepancy
between conversion and yield (Table 1) is mainly explained by
the formation of two side products: the bis(3-indolyl)methane
species 4 and tryptophol (5). The bis(indole) 4, arising from
indole to the transient azafulvene,14 did not
addition of
undergo conversion to 3a under the reaction conditions, but
some degradation of 4 did take place, suggesting that 4 is not a
the
plausible intermediate of

the reaction.

formation of
formation of the intermediate amido aldehyde, which is in
equilibrium/tautomerization with the reactive N-acetyliminium
species that undergoes amidoalkylation with the incoming
indole, prior to return of hydrogen. This sequence accounts for
the diﬀerent regioselectivities in the alkylation process, without
a less direct C−N oxidation step.15 Although to obtain pure 3a
ﬂash chromatography on silica gel was necessary, the removal of
side products was simple due to their small amount and high
lipophilicity in comparison to tryptamines.

Next, we investigated the inﬂuence of the base on the model
reaction. Increasing the quantity of base to a stoichiometric
amount slightly improved the yield of the reaction (Table 1,
entry 10). Most
importantly, we discovered that when
powdered Cs2CO3 was used as the base,
the desired N-
acetyltryptamine was obtained in a synthetically useful yield
(Table 1, entry 16). Lower conversions were generally observed
when stronger bases such as t-BuOK and t-BuONa were
employed (Table 1, entries 11 and 12), presumably due to
partial hydrolysis of the ethanolamide used as the electrophile.
A very low amount of the desired N-acetyltryptamine was also
obtained by using solid NaHCO3 or K3PO4 as the base (Table
1, entries 13 and 15), highlighting the importance of Cs2CO3 in
this reaction. As expected, the reaction without the use of
catalyst failed to provide the desired product, and the starting
material was recovered (Table 1, entry 21). On comparison of
the amounts of electrophile used, the best results were obtained

by applying 3 equiv of N-acetylethanolamine (Table 1, entries
16, 18, and 19). Interestingly, no overalkylation products were
ever observed.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
With the optimal reaction conditions established, we sought
to probe the scope of the amine protecting groups that are
amenable to this procedure. We investigated the use of
alternative protecting groups that not only would allow eﬃcient
alkylation but also would be removed easily under relatively
mild conditions. We tried to replace N-Ac with a traditional,
easily removable amino protecting group such N-COCF3, N-
Cbz, or N-Ts. Unfortunately, N-COCF3 and N-Cbz were very
unstable and decomposed quickly under the basic reaction
conditions.
Interestingly, using N-Cbz-ethanolamine, we
obtained only 3-benzylindole, which probably formed by the
borrowing hydrogen reaction of indole with benzyl alcohol
generated by an intramolecular cyclization to the corresponding
oxazolidinone. Accordingly, N-benzylethanolamine (2c) selec-
tively furnished the desired N-benzyltryptamine, though in a
yield lower than that for N-acetylethanolamine (2a) (Scheme
1). In sharp contrast, the reaction of N-Ts-ethanolamine failed
to provide the expected product, and the starting material was
recovered almost quantitatively. We believe that a stable
sulfonamido-iridium complex is formed, blocking the metal
from participating productively in the catalytic cycle. Finally,
when the phthalimido group was used as a protecting group, a
complex mixture of products was obtained (probably because it
was partially reduced), precluding its use in our protocol. When

■ CONCLUSION

In summary, the direct synthesis of diversely functionalized N-
acetyltryptamines, including melatonin and luzindole, via the
modern “borrowing hydrogen” strategy is presented. The new
iridium-catalyzed C3-indole dehydration/alkylation protocol
utilizes N-acetylethanolamine as a simple aminoethylene
alkylating agent and source of hydrogen, avoiding the use of
an external reducing agent. The experimental procedure for this
metal-catalyzed direct alkylation of diﬀerent indoles is simple
and removal of side products is not a problem. This highly
atom economical and environmentally benign process requires
only inexpensive reagents, tolerates a range of functionalities,
and may have applications in natural product synthesis and
medicinal chemistry. The identiﬁcation of more eﬃcient
catalytic systems to access a wider range of nitrogen-containing
alcohols beyond ethanolamine as well as milder
reaction
conditions is the focus of current eﬀorts in our laboratories.

General Procedure for the N-Deacetylation. Ammonium
bromide (49 mg, 0.5 mmol), ethylenediamine (0.135 mL, 2 mmol),
and N-acetyltryptamine derivative (0.5 mmol) were mixed in a suitable
vial ﬁtted with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture was then heated to 100
°C in a microwave apparatus (250 W) for 7 h. After it was cooled to
room temperature,
the crude reaction mixture was diluted with
CH2Cl2 and the desired tryptamine was extracted with an aqueous
solution of 1 M HCl. The aqueous layer was then made basic by
addition of aqueous NaOH (1 M) and then extracted with CH2Cl2.
The combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried over
Na2SO4, and concentrated by distillation at reduced pressure, giving a
crude residue which was puriﬁed by ﬁltration on a ﬂash chromato-
graphic column of silica gel (CH2Cl2/MeOH/TEA 90/9/1).
