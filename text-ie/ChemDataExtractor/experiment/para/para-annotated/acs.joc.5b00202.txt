ABSTRACT: Farnesyl diphosphate synthase catalyzes the
sequential chain elongation reactions between isopentenyl
diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP)
to form geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and between IPP and GPP
to give farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Bisubstrate analogues
containing the allylic and homoallylic substrates were
synthesized by joining fragments for IPP and the allylic
diphosphates with a C−C bond between the methyl group at
C3 in IPP and the Z-methyl group at C3 in DMAPP (3-OPP)
and GPP (4-OPP), respectively. These constructs placed
substantial limits on the conformational space available to the
analogues relative to the two substrates. The key features of the synthesis of bisubstrate analogues 3-OPP and 4-OPP are a
regioselective C-alkylation of the dianion of 3-methyl-3-buten-1-ol (5), a Z-selective cuprate addition of alkyl groups to an α,β-
alkynyl ester intermediate, and diﬀerential activation of allylic and homoallylic alcohols in the analogues, followed by a
simultaneous displacement of
the leaving groups with tris(tetra-n-butylammonium) hydrogen diphosphate to give the
corresponding bisdiphosphate analogues. The bisubstrate analogues were substrates for FPP synthase, giving novel seven-
membered ring analogues of GPP and FPP. The catalytic eﬃciencies for cyclization of 3-OPP and 4-OPP were similar to those
for chain elongation with IPP and DMAPP.

■ INTRODUCTION
Isoprenoid compounds are synthesized by nature’s most diverse
biosynthetic pathway, which is responsible for the production
of a wide variety of compounds with diﬀerent carbon skeletons
and substitution patterns. Over 63 000 isoprenoid natural
products have been identiﬁed to date.1 These molecules have
numerous and diverse biological
functions and perform
essential functions in all living systems.2
reactions, which attach the hydrocarbon
chains of electrophilic allylic diphosphates to the carbon−
carbon double bond in isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), form
the core of the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway.3 Beginning
with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, C5), a series of linear
allylic diphosphates are synthesized, which,
in turn, are
substrates for biosynthesis of monoterpenes (C10), sesquiter-
penes (C15), diterpenes (C20), sterols and hopanoids (C30),
carotenoids (C40), and larger molecules.4

Prenyltransfer

Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPase) catalyzes

the
sequential chain elongation reactions between IPP and
DMAPP to form geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and between
IPP and GPP to give farnesyl diphosphate (FPP).5,6 The
enzyme belongs to the E-double bond chain elongation

enzymes in Pfam PF003487 within the larger isoprene synthase
clan8 that includes chain elongation enzymes,9 squalene10 and
phytoene synthases,11 and terpene cyclases.12 FPPase is widely
distributed in all three kingdoms of life and is most likely
essential.6 Thus
far, only one isoform of FPPase, a
homodimeric Mg2+-dependent enzyme composed of α-helices
with two signature aspartate-rich regions that bind the allylic
substrate, is known.5,13 A large body of evidence suggests the
reaction, which couples IPP with an allylic substrate,
is a
dissociative electrophilic alkylation (Scheme 1).14 Although
FPPase is highly selective for synthesis of GPP and FPP, small
changes in the structure of the enzyme through site-directed
mutagenesis or the structure of the substrate increase the
promiscuity of
typical of
carbocationic reactions.9 This phenomenon is also observed
for terpene cyclases15 and squalene synthase.16 Thus,
the
precise topology of the enzyme−substrate complex appears to
be crucial for maintaining strict regiocontrol during catalysis by
isoprenoid synthases.

<para sub=“ques”>
A substantial body of work with simple alkyl analogues of
IPP and DMAPP indicates that FPPase accepts a large variety
of alternate substrates to give products consistent with chain
elongation.17 However, the chemoselectivity of the enzyme was
compromised by bisubstrate analogues 1-OPP and 2-OPP,
where the IPP and DMAPP fragments were joined by a
methylene bridge between the Z-methyl group at C3 in
DMAPP and the E- or Z-locus at C4 in IPP to limit the number
of conformations accessible to IPP and DMAPP in the active
site (Figure 1).18 Both analogues were alternate substrates with

catalytic eﬃciencies (kcat/KM) that were ∼10-fold lower than
those for IPP and DMAPP. However, the analogues were
promiscuous, giving a mixture of double bond and rearranged
isomers, which resulted from binding and catalysis of multiple
conformers of the analogues, indicating that they did not adopt
a single low energy conformation when bound in the active
site.18
</para>
<para sub=“ques”>
Inspection of models indicated that a bisubstrate analogue
where the IPP and DMAPP fragments were joined by a bond
between the Z-methyl group in DMAPP and the methyl group
in IPP could fold to a position in which C4 in the IPP fragment
is in a plane above C1 in the DMAPP fragment, resulting in an
orientation compatible with electrophilic alkylation of the “C3−
C4” double bond in the IPP fragment (Figure 1). We
synthesized analogues 3-OPP and 4-OPP as bisubstrate mimics
of IPP/DMAPP and IPP/GPP and now report kinetic and
product studies that conﬁrm their compatibility with the active
site of avian FPPase.

■ RESULTS
<para sub=“opt”>
Retrosynthesis of the Bisubstrate Analogues. The
overall strategy for synthesis of the bisubstrate analogues relied
on a simultaneous introduction of the sensitive allylic and
homoallylic diphosphates using tris(tetra-n-butylammonium)
hydrogen diphosphate. The retrosynthesis of 3-OPP and 4-
OPP is outlined in Scheme 2. The diphosphate residues were
introduced by displacing the homoallylic tosylates and allylic

[1-3H]3-OPP and [1-3H]4-OPP were synthesized from 3-

the corresponding aldehydes, without puriﬁcation, were

The allylic hydroxyl groups were converted to the correspond-

(similar results were seen for 3-OPP). Upon completion (12
h), a broad singlet (∼ −7 ppm) and doublet (∼ −10 ppm) in a

overlap of the singlet from inorganic pyrophosphate with one

lyzed to inorganic phosphate by treatment with alkaline

■ DISCUSSION
<para sub=“props”>
3-OPP and 4-OPP are excellent substitutes for IPP and the
allylic substrates DMAPP or GPP in incubations with avian
FPP synthase. The exclusive products of each reaction are
cycloheptene derivatives 17-OPP and 18-OPP, whose
structures are the logical consequence of an intramolecular
condensation between the IPP and DMAPP/GPP units of the
bisubstrate analogues (Figure 6). The stereochemistry of the

exocyclic double bonds in 17-OPP and 18-OPP is consistent
with the E-selective chain elongation reaction normally
catalyzed by the enzyme. The catalytic eﬃciencies
for
processing the bisubstrate analogues are only slightly lower
than those for the natural substrates.
</para>
Article
<para sub=“props”>
Inspection of models for bisubstrate analogues 3-OPP and 4-
OPP suggests that they can fold into conformations where the
allylic moiety is in a plane parallel to the plane of the IPP
double bond in orientations that permit an intramolecular
alkylation of the “IPP” double bond to produce 17-OPP and
18-OPP, respectively. However, the conformations of hydro-
carbon chains in IPP and thioDMAPP, an unreactive substrate
analogue of DMAPP,28 for the E. coli FPPase complex are
substantially diﬀerent.13b As a result, the carbon atoms that join
the IPP and allylic fragments in the bisubstrate analogues are
located ∼5.9 Å apart in the E. coli structure. Thus, although 3-
OPP and 4-OPP are excellent substrates for FPPase and give a
single product, they cannot bind in conformations where their
hydrocarbon chains can be superimposed on those of the
hydrocarbon moieties in IPP and DMAPP.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
To resolve this discrepancy, we conducted docking studies
for 3-OPP and 4-OPP with a homology model of avian FPPase
constructed from a crystal structure of the closed (reactive)
form of the human enzyme.27 These structures were compared
to the crystal structure of E. coli complexed with Mg2+, IPP, and
thioDMAPP28 (an unreactive substrate analogue of
DMAPP)13b in the closed conformation in order to explore
the diﬀerences in substrate binding between the 3-OPP and 4-
OPP and IPP/DMAPP. The active sites of FPPases have a
constellation of eight aspartate residues whose spatial
orientations are highly conserved, even among enzymes with
modest homologies. These aspartates (D1−D8) are shown in
Figure 7 for the E. coli (blue) and avian (yellow) FPPases along
with the bound ligands. Six of the aspartates (D1−D3 and D4−
D6) belong to highly conserved DDxx(xx)D motifs that anchor
the diphosphate moiety of the allylic substrate by three Mg+
atoms. Despite only 25% (BLAST E-value 1e−09) sequence
identity between the amino acid sequences of the E. coli and
the aspartate-rich:Mg2+
avian enzymes,
regions of their active sites are virtually superimposable in the
crystal and homology modeled/docked structures (Figure 7,
part a). In E. coli FPPase, the ﬁrst apartate-rich motif (D1−D3)
binds two Mg2+’s, one of which forms a bridge between the P1

and P2 phosphates of the allylic diphosphate, while the second
Mg2+ is coordinated to P1. The second motif (D4−D6) binds
the third Mg2+ in a P1-P2 bridge on the opposite face of the
diphosphate moiety. In contrast to the strong ionic interactions
between the enzyme and the allylic diphosphate through
bridging Mg2+ atoms, the IPP binding site with water molecules
surrounding the diphosphate moiety, appears to be more
ﬂexible IPP.13b
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Our docking studies suggest that the bisubstrate analogues
bind with the allylic diphosphate anchored by three magnesium
atoms in similar bridged structures. Also, the E-alkyl groups in
the DMAPP/GPP fragments are located in a hydrophobic
pocket that accommodates the growing hydrocarbon chain
during chain elongation.5 However, the locations of P1 and P2
for 3-OPP and 4-OPP (Figure 7b,c) are reversed relative to
IPP in the E. coli structure (Figure 7a), resulting in a large
change in the conformations of the atoms between P1 of the
allylic phosphate and P1 of the homoallylic phosphate in 3-
OPP and 4-OPP relative to the locations of the corresponding
atoms in IPP and thioDMAPP in the E. coli structure. The ﬂip-
ﬂop of the allylic diphosphate is necessary for the analogues to
bind in a conformation that allows
the intramolecular
electrophilic alkylation between the IPP and allylic fragments
to proceed.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
The Mg2+-aspartate-rich motifs in FPPase are essential for
catalysis and are thought to trigger the electrophilic alkylation
by activating the diphosphate moiety as a leaving group in the
stepwise mechanism for
the alkylation via an allylic
carbocation−PPi ion pair. Preservation of the Mg2+-aspartate
structure in the FPPase·bisubstrate analogue complex should
facilitate heterolytic rupture of the allylic C−O bond similar to
catalysis of chain elongation with IPP and DMAPP/GPP.
Although the distance between the reacting centers in the E. coli
FPPase·IPP·thioDMAPP complex (3.3 Å) is
substantially
shorter than that for 3-OPP (4.1 Å) or 4-OPP (4.2 Å) in
the avian homology model, the bisubstrate allylic carbocations
should be able to move toward the double bond in the IPP unit
within the ion pair following rupture of the C(1)−O bonds.
</para>
In conclusion, bisubstrate analogues 3-OPP and 4-OPP are
excellent substrates for avian FPPase to produce cycloheptenyl
products whose structures are those expected for an intra-
molecular “chain elongation” reaction. However, analysis of the
structures of E. coli FPPase·IPP·thioDMAPP and the avian
FPPase·bisubstrate complexes
the highly
conserved Mg2+-aspartate-rich motifs bind the allylic diphos-
phate moieties of the analogues in a reversed orientation from
that of DMAPP. In spite of this diﬀerence, the enzyme retains
its ability to catalyze the electrophilic alkylation reaction for the
analogues.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Methods and Materials. The reactions that required
anhydrous conditions were performed using anhydrous solvents under
a nitrogen atmosphere in oven-dried glassware (100 °C) unless
otherwise mentioned. Anhydrous Et2O, THF, CH3CN, and CH2Cl2
were obtained by passing through a column of activated alumina.29
Puriﬁcation of the organic compounds was carried out using the silica
gel ﬂash column chromatography with silica gel (230−400 mesh, 60
Å). Merck Silica Gel 60 Å F254 glass-backed TLC plates were for the
thin-layer chromatographic analysis, and the spots were visualized
using phosphomolybdic acid stain. Cellulose (ﬁbers, medium) for ﬂash
column chromatographic puriﬁcation of bisdiphosphates was pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich and used according to the procedure
described earlier.24 Dowex AG 50W-X8 cation-exchange resin

(hydrogen form, 100−20 mesh) was exchanged to the ammonium
form by washing with 3 M ammonium hydroxide solution before use.
Glass-backed cellulose TLC plates were used for
the thin-layer
chromatographic analysis of bisdiphosphates, and the spots were
visualized by 5-sulfosalisylic acid-ferric chloride. All the 1H, 13C, and
31P NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C, and chemical shifts were
reported in δ ppm (parts per million) values. 1H NMR spectra were
recorded at 300 and 600 MHz and were referenced using the residual
CHCl3 singlet at 7.26 ppm or the HDO singlet at 4.80 ppm from the
deuterated NMR solvents. 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 75 and
125 MHz and were referenced using the residual CHCl3 triplet at
77.23 ppm from the deuterated NMR solvents. 13C NMR spectra
recorded in D2O were unreferenced. 31P NMR spectra were recorded
at 121 MHz, and the 31P NMR chemical shifts were referenced to 85%
H3PO4 as an external reference. HRMS-ESI data were recorded on
LC-TOF and LTQ-FTMS mass spectrometers.

Steady-State Kinetic Studies. Assays were carried out in 100 μL
of 40 mM BHDA buﬀer, pH 7, containing 10 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2,
2 mg/mL BSA, and 0.095−9.45 μM [1-3H]3-OPP or [1-3H]4-OPP.
Samples were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was
initiated by the addition of 38 ng avian FPPase in assay buﬀer. After
incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was quenched with 200
μL of 4:1 methanol:HCl and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to
solvolyze the allylic diphosphates. The assay mixture was extracted
with 1 mL of ligroin, a 0.5 mL portion of the extract was mixed with 4
mL of scintillation cocktail, and radioactivity in the sample was
quantiﬁed by scintillation spectrometry. All assays were run as
triplicate along with a blank without avian FPPase. Initial rates
measured in the linear phase of the progress curve vs substrate
concentration were ﬁt to the hyperbolic form of the Michaelis−
Menten equation Vmax[S]/(KM +[S]), where S is the concentration of
the radiolabeled 1-OPP or 2-OPP. Values for kcat and kcat/KM were
computed and are shown in Table 1.
Homology Modeling and Docking. Homology models of avian
FPPase were created by Schrödinger Prime using the human FPPase
crystal structure (PDB code: 4KQS) as the template. The BLAST E-
value for the two sequences was 1e−177. The sequences were further
aligned using PROMALS3D (Figure S44, Supporting Information).
The models were processed by constrained minimizations (RMSD
tolerance 0.35 Å, in the presence of the co-crystallized ligands 3-OPP
and 4-OPP) with Schrödinger Protein Preparation Wizard. The
quality of the homology models was assessed using the discrete
optimized protein energy score (a statistical potential score for
evaluating protein models) in MODELLER, and a Z-score of −1.73
was obtained, implying that the quality of the models was good. The
two substrates were built manually and processed by the Schrödinger
Ligprep. The OPLS 2005 force ﬁeld was used throughout this study.
