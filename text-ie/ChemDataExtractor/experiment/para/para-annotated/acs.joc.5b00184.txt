ABSTRACT: The synthesis of the two ﬂuorinated tricyclic nucleosides 6′-F-tc-T and
6′-F-tc-5MeC, as well as the corresponding building blocks for oligonucleotide
assembly, was accomplished. An X-ray analysis of N4-benzoylated 6′-F-tc-5MeC
reavealed a 2′-exo (north) conformation of the furanose ring, characterizing it as an
RNA mimic. In contrast to observations in the bicyclo-DNA series, no short contact
between the ﬂuorine atom and the H6 of the base, reminiscent of a nonclassical F···H
hydrogen bond, could be observed. Tm measurements of modiﬁed oligodeoxynucleo-
tides with complementary RNA showed slightly sequence-dependent duplex
stabilization proﬁles with maximum ΔTm/mod values of +4.5 °C for 6′-F-tc-5MeC
and +1 °C for 6′-F-tc-T. In comparison with parent tc-modiﬁed oligonucleotides, no relevant changes in Tm were detected,
attributing the ﬂuorine substituent a neutral role in RNA aﬃnity. A structural analysis of duplexes with DNA and RNA by CD-
spectroscopy revealed a shift from B- to A-type conformation induced by the 6′-F-tc-nucleosides. This is not a speciﬁc “ﬂuorine
eﬀect”, as the same is also observed for the parent tc-modiﬁcations. The two ﬂuorinated tc-nucleosides were also incorporated
into a pure tricyclo-DNA backbone and showed no discrimination in Tm with complementary RNA, demonstrating that 6′-F
substitution is also compatible within fully modiﬁed tc-oligonucleotides.

■ INTRODUCTION

Fluorine is widely appreciated in small molecule medicinal
chemistry due its metabolic stability-enhancing properties and
its unique protein-binding characteristics.1−3 For
similar
reasons, ﬂuorinated DNA analogues are of
in
oligonucleotide therapeutic approaches. Among the ﬁrst
ﬂuorinated oligonucleotides investigated were the 2′-deoxy-2′-
ﬂuoro RNA (F-RNA) and the 2′deoxy-2′-ﬂuoro-arabino
nucleic acids (F-ANA, Figure 1). While both analogues have
been known for quite some time,
structural and
biophysical features have only recently been characterized in
detail. Compared to their 2′-hydroxy variants RNA and ANA,
both the F-RNA and F-ANA analogues bind with higher aﬃnity

interest

their

(ΔTm = 1−2 °C/mod) to complementary RNA. The origin of
the higher duplex stability in the case of F-RNA was attributed
to improved hydrogen-bonding and base-stacking as a
consequence of the polar C2′−F bond.4,5 In the case of F-
ANA, internucleoside F−H8 pseudo hydrogen bonds, that are
particularly strong at purine/pyrimidine sequence steps, have
been invoked as a stability-enhancing feature.6,7 F-RNA and F-
ANA have been shown to improve the performance of
therapeutic siRNAs.8,9 Due to its unique RNaseH activating
properties, F-ANA was also investigated in classical antisense
applications.10

Recently there has been a growing interest in investigating
the eﬀect of ﬂuorine substitution in more complex,
carbohydrate-modiﬁed oligonucleotide analogues such as F-
HNA and its 2′-epimer Ara-F-HNA.11,12 While F-HNA shows
increased thermal stability (ΔTm = +2 °C/mod) in complex
with complementary RNA, the F-Ara-HNA analogue exhibits
the opposite eﬀect (ΔTm = −3 °C/mod). The destabilization of
Ara-F-HNA was attributed to repulsive steric eﬀects of the
ﬂuoro substituent onto the 5′-adjacent nucleotide unit.11 Also
ﬂuorinated versions of CeNA13 and cLNA14 were investigated.
In these cases ﬂuorine substitution does not contribute
signiﬁcantly to duplex stability. The most recent additions to
the palette of ﬂuorinated oligonucleotide analogues were F-
NMC and Ara-F-NMC,15 both derived from the northern
methanocarbacyclic nucleoside (NMC) analogues.16,17 Here
again, F-NMC stabilized duplexes by +2.2 °C/mod on average
while Ara-F-NMC was destabilizing by −2.8 °C/mod. The
intrinsic contribution of the ﬂuorine atom to thermal stability in

In terms of biological activity it has been shown previously
that F-HNA gapmers can down-regulate gene expression in

vivo in liver tissue more potently than LNA despite lower target
aﬃnity.11 Thus, the higher potency of F-HNA seems to be the
consequence of either improved biostability or more eﬃcient
plasma transport or both. Other recent observations, attributing

binding factor complex (ILF2/3).20
Given these intriguing properties of ﬂuorinated oligonucleo-
tides, and building on earlier work on 6′-F-bicyclo-DNA,21 we
decided to investigate 6′-F-tc-DNA (Figure 1). In the following
we present
the
corresponding 6′-F-tc-nucleosides containing the bases thymine
and 5-methylcytosine, as well as the inﬂuence on duplex

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

in multiple portions,
<para sub="scope">
Synthesis of the Phosphoramidite Building Blocks 11
and 18. Drawing on earlier experiences during the synthesis of
6′-ﬂuorinated bicyclo-DNA,21 we envisaged to introduce the
ﬂuorine atom in an early step of the synthesis via electrophilic
ﬂuorination of a metalated bicyclic sugar
intermediate.
Consequently, we started our synthetic journey with the
known bicyclic silyl enol ether 1 (Scheme 1).22 Bromination of
1 with Br2 at −78 °C gave the expected bromide 2 in 90% yield.
To exclude side reactions during the following metal−halogen
exchange, the free OH group in 2 was protected as a TMS ether
(→ 3). Electrophilic ﬂuorination of 3 worked best if t-BuLi was
used as lithiation reagent and if NFSI was added in one portion
at a temperature of −120 °C. Temperatures above −78 °C, or
addition of NFSI
led to substantial
decomposition and thus reduced yield. The treatment with an
acidic ion-exchange resin after quenching of
the reaction
quantitatively removed the TMS group, resulting in a 60% yield
of ﬂuoro silyl enol ether 4. The rationale of removing the TMS
group at this stage was based on the hypothesis that the
corresponding hydroxyl group could help in directing the
subsequent cyclopropanation reaction to the convex side of the
bicyclic ring system. Indeed, cyclopropanation of 4 with a Zn−
carbene complex in homogeneous solution yielded exclusively
the exotricyclic sugar 5 in good yield but only if TFA was added
as accelerator.23 To prepare for β-selective nucleosidation,24,25
compound 5 was converted to enol ether 6 with TMSOTf,
which was then reacted with in situ persilylated thymine and
NIS, yielding iodo-nucleoside 7 in 85% yield in a stereospeciﬁc
manner. Removal of the iodine via radical reduction with
Bu3SnH ﬁnally gave the expected O-protected 6′-ﬂuoro
tricyclothymidine 8 in excellent yields. From here the synthesis

the phosphoramidite building block was completed by
of
standard removal of the silyl protecting groups (→ 9) followed
by dimethoxytritylation (→ 10) and phosphitylation with 2-
cyanoethyl diisopropylamino chlorophosphine (CEP-Cl) to
give 11 in a respectable overall yield of 13.4% starting from 1.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Given the availability of the thymine nucleoside 8 and known
procedures to interconvert pyrimidine bases on the level of
nucleosides and oligonucleotides,26,27 we next envisioned the
synthesis of the building block 18 containing the base 5-
methylcytosine. To this end, compound 8 was transformed into
the triazolide 12 with 1,2,4-triazole and POCl3 (Scheme 2).
Treatment of 12 with ammonia then aﬀorded the 5-
methlytricyclocytidine 13 in 60% yield over two steps. N4-
Benzoylation of 13 with Bz2O yielded the two nucleosides 14
and 15 that diﬀered only by the presence or absence of the 3′-
O-TMS group. This was of no harm, as the silyl groups in both
14 and 15 were removed in the next step, yielding 16 in high
yield. The synthesis of the phosphoramidite building block 18
was then completed via standard dimethoxytritylation (→ 17)
followed by phosphitylation as described above.

X-ray Structure of 16. To conﬁrm the relative
conﬁguration and to determine the eﬀect of
the ﬂuorine
substituent on the conformation of the tricyclic ring system,
crystals of nucleoside 16 were grown and subjected to X-ray
analysis. The molecular structure is depicted in Figure 2.
<para sub=“props”>
The furanose unit in 16 adopts a 2′-exo conformation with a
pseudorotation phase angle P of 336° and a maximum torsion
angle ν
thus belongs clearly to the N-type
conformation, typically adopted by RNA nucleosides.28 The
base is oriented in the central anti range (χ = −176.2°).
Comparison of 16 with the structure of 6′-ﬂuoro-bicyclo-T21
reveals two major diﬀerences: First, the distance F−H6 in 16
(3.194 Å) is too long for a nonclassical F−H hydrogen bond
while the same distance in 6′-ﬂuoro-bc-T (2.865 Å) is indicative
for such a weak interaction. Furthermore, there is no linear
arrangement of F−H6−C6 in 16, whereas this is clearly the
case in 6′-ﬂuoro-bc-T. Support for the absence of such an
interaction in 16 comes also from the fact that there are no F−
H6 or F−C6 couplings observable in the 1H and 13C NMR
spectra of 16, which contrasts the ﬁndings in the case of 6′-
ﬂuoro-bc-T. Thus, compared to 6′-ﬂuoro-bc-T,
the base-
orienting H−F interaction of the ﬂuorine is lost in 16. The
second structural change resides within the furanose con-
formation, which is 1′-exo (S-type) in the case of 6′-
ﬂuorobicyclo-T and 2′-exo (N-type) in the case of 16. With
respect
to the nonﬂuorinated tricyclo-T nucleoside which

atom helps to drive the furanose conformation of the tricyclic

oxynucleotides ON1−10, containing the 6′-ﬂuoro-tc-nucleo-
sides (Table 1), were synthesized on a 1.3 μmol scale by
standard phosphoramidite chemistry, utilizing the building
blocks 11 and 18 (for details, see Experimental Section). Crude
oligonucleotides were deprotected and detached from the solid
support by standard ammonia treatment (33% NH4OH, 55 °C,
overnight) and puriﬁed by ion exchange HPLC. The

<para sub=“props”>
Oligodeoxynucleotides containing single 6′-ﬂuoro tc-T
mutations (ON1−3) lead to duplexes with complementary
DNA and RNA with neutral to slightly enhanced stability in a
slightly sequence-dependent context, compared to unmodiﬁed
duplexes. Interestingly, the stabilization (ΔTm/mod) is a bit
stronger in duplexes with complementary DNA as compared to
RNA. Double substitutions in a noncontiguous order (ON3)
tendentially lead to poorer duplex stabilization with RNA
compared to multiple substitutions in a consecutive manner
(ON4). This is in agreement with earlier observations in the
series of tc-DNA30 and has been ascribed to an incremental
energetic penalty arising from increasing numbers of structural

heterobackbone junctions. Replacing natural dC with 6′-ﬂuoro-
tc-5MeC units (ON5−7) leads to a somewhat diﬀerent picture.
Again,
in a slightly sequence-dependent context, duplex
stabilization is signiﬁcantly higher (up to +4.5 °C/mod) as
compared to dC and more pronounced with RNA as a
complement. In addition, there seems to be almost no energetic
penalty as a function of
the number of noncontiguous
substitutions (ON5 and ON6 vs ON7). While it is known
that the base thymine in the tc-DNA context is least stabilizing
compared to the other three bases,30,31 the origin of this eﬀect
is yet unknown and awaits further structural investigations.

tc-C, and tc-5MeC residues,

To elucidate the role of the ﬂuorine atom and the methyl
group in 5-methylcytosine on RNA duplex stability, we
compared ΔTm/mod data with that of oligonucleotides
respectively
containing tc-T,
(Table 2). From this set of data it becomes evident that in
both the T- and C-series, the 6′-ﬂuorine atom behaves as
neutral and does not signiﬁcantly add to duplex stability. This is
in agreement with the absence of any F−H5 pseudo hydrogen
bond, as found in the X-ray structure of 16, and supports our
earlier hypothesis that this interaction is responsible for the
increase in stability in the bc-DNA series.21 At the same time, it
is in agreement with the properties of other 6′-modiﬁed tc-
DNA derivatives for which it was shown before that this
position can be chemically modiﬁed without compromising
RNA aﬃnity.24 In the C-series, the 5-methyl group of cytosine
brings about 0.2−1.2 °C/mod of additional thermal stability
also in the context of the tricyclic nucleoside structure. As for
the case of 5-methyldeoxycytidine in DNA duplexes, this is
most likely the consequence of improved stacking interactions

<para sub=“props”>
In the context of future applications as steric block or splice
switching oligonucleotides, we also investigated the fully
modiﬁed tc-oligonucleotides ON8−10 containing 6′-ﬂuoro-tc-
T units. These oligonucleotides all carry a 5′-phosphate unit in
order to confer chemical stability to the 5′-terminal nucleoside
unit during oligonucleotide deprotection.33 As can be seen from
Table 3, duplexes with complementary DNA (non 5′-
phosphorylated) are somewhat destabilized in the presence of
the ﬂuorine atom, while a slight stabilization in a sequence-
dependent manner occurs with RNA (non 5′-phosphorylated)
as complement. Thus, 6′-ﬂuorination is fully compatible with
the tc-DNA backbone and does not lead to loss of RNA aﬃnity.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
To determine the eﬀect of 6′-F-tc-T units on duplex
conformation, we measured CD-spectra of duplexes of ON4
with complementary DNA and RNA and compared them with
the corresponding unmodiﬁed duplexes and with duplexes
containing tc-T instead of 6′-F-tc-T units (Figure 3). The
largest structural deviation occurs in the DNA/DNA duplex
series where both the 6′-F-tc-T and the tc-T units drive the
duplex conformation from B to A-like. There are no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between duplexes with tc-T or 6′-ﬂuoro-tc-T,
indicating that both adopt an N-type nucleoside conformation.
The tendency to adopt a more A-like conformation in duplexes
with tc-T or 6′-F-tc-T units is also present in the DNA/RNA
duplex series. Again, there are no large diﬀerences between the
tc-T- and 6′-F-tc-T-containing duplexes, perhaps with the
exception that the maximum positive ellipticity around 270 nm
is blue-shifted by ca. 10 nm in the case of the latter duplex, with
a yet unknown implication on the helix structure.

■ CONCLUSION
We have accomplished the synthesis of the two 6′-ﬂuorinated
tc-nucleoside building blocks 11 and 18 and have incorporated
them into oligodeoxynucleotides and tc-oligonucleotides. We
analyzed complementary DNA and RNA aﬃnity by Tm
measurements and determined structural eﬀects of ﬂuorine
substitution on duplex conformation by CD-spectroscopy. On
the basis of the X-ray structure of 16 as well as on 1H and 13C
NMR coupling data on the nucleosides and derivatives, we
could not ﬁnd any indications for short ﬂuorine-base F−H6
contacts. This is in surprising contrast to ﬁndings in the 6′-
ﬂuoro-bc-DNA series, where such short contacts were
observed. Compared to the nonﬂuorinated tc-nucleosides, we
ﬁnd that the ﬂuorine substituent does not signiﬁcantly alter the
the corresponding duplexes,
thermal melting properties of
irrespective of
the nature of
the base (thymine vs 5-
methylcytosine). This is in agreement with the absence of the

glycosidic bond-constraining nature of the F−H6 interaction
that adds up to +2 °C/mod in Tm in the case of the bicyclo-
DNA series. The 6′-ﬂuoro modiﬁcation is also compatible with
the tc-DNA backbone, as no change or even a slight increase in
Tm with complementary RNA was observed. The ﬂuorine atom
also does not signiﬁcantly alter
the duplex conformation
compared to nonﬂuorinated tc-DNA as can be seen from the
corresponding CD-spectra. On the basis of these encouraging
biophysical data, we are now planning to investigate functional
eﬃcacy, cellular uptake, and in vivo tissue distribution of
antisense tc-oligonucleotides containing these 6′-F-tc-nucleo-
sides.

General Methods. All reactions were performed under argon in
oven-dried glassware. Solvents were dried by ﬁltration over activated
alumina or by storage over molecular sieves (4 Å). Column
chromatography (CC) was performed on silica gel 60 (230−400
mesh, neutralized with 0.1% of w/Ca). All solvents for CC were of
technical grade and distilled prior to use. Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on silica gel plates. Compounds were visualized
either under UV light or by staining in dip solution A: CerIV-sulfate
(10.5 g), phosphormolybdenic acid (21 g), concd H2SO4 (60 mL),
H2O (900 mL); or B: KMnO4 (6 g), K2CO3 (40 g), 15% NaOH (3
mL) in H2O (800 mL)), followed by heating with a heat gun. NMR
spectra were recorded at 300 or 400 MHz (1H), at 75 or 100 MHz
(13C), at 376 MHz (19F), and at 162 MHz (31P). Chemical shifts (δ)
are reported relative to the undeuterated residual solvent peak
(CHCl3: 7.24 ppm (1H) and 77.2 ppm (13C); DMSO-d6: 2.50 ppm

standards, respectively. Electrospray ionization in the positive mode
(ion trap, ESI+) was used for high resolution mass detection. The

temperature was allowed to rise to rt. Stirring was continued for
another 2 h. Then the reaction mixture was poured into H2O and
extracted with Et2O. The combined organic layers were washed with
water, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated. The residual dark oil was

Oligonucleotide Synthesis and Puriﬁcation. Oligonucleotides
ON1−10 were synthesized by standard solid-phase phosphoramidite
methodology on a 1.3 μmol scale on a Pharmacia LKB Gene
Assembler Special DNA Synthesizer using a slightly modiﬁed DNA
synthesis program. Natural phosphoramidites (dT, dC4Bz, dA6Bz,
dG2dmf) were coupled as a 0.1 M solution in CH3CN, and
tricyclophosphoramidites as 0.15 M solutions in CH3CN, with the
exception of 6′-F-tc-T, 6′-F-tc-5MeC4Bz, and tc-A that were used as
0.15 M solutions in DCE. The coupling step was 90 s for natural
phosphoramidites and 12 min for
tricyclo-phosphoramidites. As
coupling reagent, 5-(ethylthio)-1H-tetrazole (0.25 M in CH3CN)
was used. Capping, oxidation, and detritylation were carried out using
standard solutions as described in the manufacturer’s protocol.
Deprotection of the oligonucleotides after assembly and detachment
from solid support was eﬀected by standard ammonia treatment (33%
aq NH3, 16 h, 55 °C). The crude oligomers were puriﬁed by ion-
exchange HPLC using a DNAPAC PA200, 4 × 250 mm analytical
column (Dionex). Mobile phases A: 25 mM TRIZMA in H2O, pH 8.0.
B: 25 mM TRIZMA, 1.25 M NaCl in H2O, pH 8.0. or A: 10 mM
NaOH in H2O, pH 12.0. B: 10 mM NaOH, 1.5 M NaCl in H2O, pH
12.0, ﬂow 1 mL/min detection at 260 nm. Puriﬁed oligonucleotides
were desalted over Sep-Pak cartridges, quantiﬁed at 260 nm using
extiction coeﬃcients as determined previously for tricyclo-nucleo-
sides,31 and analyzed by ESI−-mass spectrometry. Oligonucleotides
were then stored at −18 °C.
UV Melting Curves. Absorbances were monitored at 260 nm, and
the heating rate was set to 0.5 °C/min. A cooling−heating−cooling
cycle in the temperature range 20−80 °C was applied. Tm values were
obtained from the derivative curves using Varian WinUV software. To
avoid evaporation of the solution, the sample solutions were covered
with a layer of dimethylpolysiloxane. All measurements were carried
out in 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na-phosphate, pH 7.0, with duplex
concentration of 2 μM.

CD-Spectroscopy. CD-spectra were recorded using the same
buﬀer conditions and oligonucleotide concentrations as for UV
melting curves. All CD-spectra were collected at 20 °C between 210 to
320 nm at a 50 nm/min rate and were baseline-corrected against
buﬀer. The reported spectra correspond to the average of at least three
scans.
