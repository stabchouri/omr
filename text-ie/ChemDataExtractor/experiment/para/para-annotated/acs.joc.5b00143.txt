ABSTRACT: The direct arylation of the C4 position of both N-alkyl- and N-
arylsydnones with aryl/heteroaryl chlorides has been realized. The reaction is quite
general and allows access to a wide range of 4-substituted sydnones. Yields of more
challenging substrates can be improved through the use of aryl bromides.

P yrazoles are common fragments in biologically active

molecules, and their presence in a number of blockbuster
drugs1 and agrochemicals2 has led to widespread interest in
developing new strategies to access these valuable structures.
Recent studies in our laboratories have focused on the use of
sydnones for the preparation of functionalized pyrazoles via
alkyne cycloadditions, with a particular focus on understanding
the underlying reasons for reaction regioselectivity.3−5 From a
synthetic standpoint, a diverse range of pyrazoles can,
in
principle, be made available by a sequence involving sydnone
functionalization followed by cycloaddition. As shown in
Scheme 1, this strategy allows pyrazoles to be generated in
two steps with the introduction of new substituents at all
carbon atoms on the heteroaromatic ring.

showed that this competing side reaction could become quite
signiﬁcant; direct arylation of 1b provided a 3:1 mixture of 6
and 7, albeit in high yield.
We speculated that byproducts 5 and 7 formed as a result of
aryl−aryl interchange from the triphenylphosphine ligand (via
I/II/III) because of a slow transmetalation step in the cross-
coupling reaction (Scheme 3). This hypothesis was based on
the mechanistic studies of related aryl−aryl
interchange of
in palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling
phosphine ligands
reactions reported by Novak et al.11
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
To overcome the issue of aryl−aryl interchange we decided
to focus our optimization studies on the nature of the ligand,
our
results are shown in Table 1. Removing phosphine
altogether resulted in a poor yield of sydnone (entry 1),
while tributylphosphine furnished 2 in moderate yield (entry
2). As we had identiﬁed the transmetalation step as
problematic, we postulated that Buchwald’s biarylphosphine
ligands could promote the cross-coupling and ultimately lead to
a more general set of conditions.12 Indeed, we were pleased to
ﬁnd that employing 10 mol % of XPhos with 5 mol %

We have reported preliminary attempts to realize this idea by
implementing a Suzuki−Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of 4-
bromosydnones,
followed by cycloaddition with a series of
terminal alkynes and alkynylboronates.6,7 Our method was
superseded however by Moran and Rodriguez, who described a
palladium-catalyzed direct arylation approach that avoided the
need for bromination of the parent sydnone.8,9
<para sub=“opt”>
In connection with our interest

in developing modular
approaches to bioactive N-arylpyrazoles, we set out to employ a
sequential sydnone direct arylation−cycloaddition for
the
synthesis of ER-34122, a potent dual 5-lipoxygenase/cyclo-
oxygenase inhibitor with anti-inﬂammatory activity.10 As shown
in Scheme 2, employing Moran’s conditions for the direct
arylation provided the expected product 2 in good yield.
Surprisingly, however, this compound was accompanied by a
small amount of the corresponding 4-Ph sydnone 5 which

Pd(OAc)2 aﬀorded 2 in excellent yield (entry 3). Moreover,
this catalyst system permitted previously unreactive aryl
chlorides to participate in the direct arylation quite smoothly
under these new conditions with only a small erosion of yield
(entry 4). Finally, we found the reaction to be amenable to
scale up, delivering 2 on gram scale in almost quantitative yield.

Using optimized conditions, we next decided to explore the
scope of the direct arylation using 4-chlorotoluene, and a series
of sydnones; our results are shown in Table 2. A range of N-aryl
groups were well tolerated in the coupling (entries 1−5).
However, it should be noted that 4-ﬂuorophenyl sydnone 12
(entry 5) was unstable in solution and decomposed in
chloroform and dichloromethane. We were also pleased to
ﬁnd that N-alkylsydnones coupled smoothly (entries 6−8)
when a reduced reaction temperature of 80 °C was used. This
was consistent with Moran’s observations that lower temper-
atures were required for the coupling of N-alkylsydnones, due
to thermal instability.8

We next explored the scope of the direct arylation reaction

a series of aryl (entries 1−7) and heteroaromatic substrates
(entries 8, 9), although 4-chloroaniline and 4-chlorophenol
provided the corresponding sydnones (19 and 20, respectively)
in poorer yields. Fortunately, however, these sydnones could be
obtained in much higher yields when the corresponding aryl
bromides were used instead (Scheme 4). We were also pleased
to ﬁnd that the use of an aryl bromide improved the yield of
direct arylation with N-benzylsydnone,

General Procedure for the Direct Arylation of Sydnones. A
ﬂask equipped with a reﬂux condenser was charged with a mixture of
sydnone (1 equiv), aryl halide (1.5 equiv), palladium acetate (5 mol
%), XPhos (10 mol %), and potassium carbonate (2−3 equiv) in DMF
(0.1−0.5 M) under an atmosphere of nitrogen and heated at 80−120
°C for 16 h. The reaction was allowed to cool to ambient temperature,
and water was added. The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl
acetate/40−60 petroleum ether (9:1), and the combined organic
layers were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. Flash silica
chromatography (eluting solvent 20%−100% ethyl acetate in 40−60
petroleum ether) aﬀorded the target 3,4-disubstituted sydnones. The
compounds could be further puriﬁed by recrystallization from ethanol

In conclusion, we have developed a highly versatile and

The utility of the products was demonstrated in cycloaddition

2-((3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenyl)amino)acetic Acid. To a suspension
of the ethyl 2-((3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)amino)acetate (12.1 g, 44.9
mmol) in water/ethanol (150 mL, 9:1) was added sodium hydroxide
(2.7 g, 67.5 mmol), and the mixture was heated at reﬂux for 1 h. The
reaction was allowed to cool to rt before acidifying to pH 4−6 with
concentrated hydrochloric acid, leading to product precipitation. The
brown solid was isolated and dried in vacuo before recrystallization
from ethanol aﬀording 2-((3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)amino)acetic acid

N-(3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenyl)sydnone (1b). To a suspension of 2-
((3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)amino)acetic acid (4.37 g, 18.1 mmol) in
DME (40 mL) was added isopentyl nitrite (IAN) (2.33 g, 19.9 mmol),
and the reaction stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The mixture was
concentrated in vacuo followed by the addition of petroleum ether/
diethyl ether (15:1), and the liquor was decanted to provide the crude
nitrosamine precipitate. CAUTION: Nitrosamine intermediates are
highly toxic and suspected carcinogens. The crude material was
suspended in CH2Cl2 (40 mL) under nitrogen, and triﬂuoroacetic
anhydride (TFAA) (5.70 g, 27.1 mmol) was carefully added at 0 °C.
The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for
90 min, after which the reaction was carefully quenched with saturated

N-bromosuccinamide (5.49 g, 30.9 mmol), and AIBN (9 mg 0.05
mmol) in CH2Cl2 (18 mL) was irradiated with a tungsten lamp for 2 h

before being poured into water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The
combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4 and ﬁltered, and the
solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude material was dissolved in
THF (10 mL) and cooled at −78 οC before the dropwise addition of

reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a
further 2 h. The mixture was then poured in aqueous NH4Cl and
extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers were dried
over MgSO4 and ﬁltered, and volatiles were removed in vacuo. The
