ABSTRACT: Herein is
reported a study of asymmetric
decarboxylative Mannich addition reactions between (Ss)-N-t-
butylsulﬁnyl-3,3,3-triﬂuoroacetaldimine and Schiﬀ bases derived
from various aldehydes and lithium 2,2-diphenylglycinate. These
reactions proceed with excellent diastereoselectivities and good
chemical yields, providing a practical method for preparation of
triﬂuoromethyl-containing vicinal diamines. The procedures can
be conducted under convenient conditions,
rendering this
approach of high synthetic value.

■ INTRODUCTION

In particular,

Numerous natural and synthetic biologically active compounds
contain a 1,2-diamino functionality (vicinal diamines) as a key
pharmacophoric moiety.1
such types of
therapeutic activities as anti-cancer,2 -depressant,3 and -hyper-
tensive4 are commonly associated with the 1,2-diamino group.5
importance of vicinal diamines has
This proven biological
stimulated considerable research activity;6 however,
the
development of new methods for more generalized and
practical preparation of 1,2-diamines remains a signiﬁcant
challenge.7 Considering the exciting biological proﬁle of vicinal
diamines, the ﬂuorinated derivatives of this class of compounds
might be of great pharmaceutical potential.8,9 In fact, it is quite
established that introduction of ﬂuorine into the molecules of
biologically active compounds usually leads to improved
eﬃcacy, enhanced membrane permeability, and signiﬁcantly
higher stability toward oxidative degradation.10,11 Furthermore,
the current pharmaceutical industry critically depends on the
new methodological developments
in ﬂuorine chemistry,
aiming at preparation of novel ﬂuorinated structural types.12
In this regard, 1-triﬂuoromethyl-1,2-diamines 1 (Scheme 1)
represent a quite formidable and virtually unexplored chemical

entity. Indeed, only in 2014, the De Kimpe13 and Fustero14
groups described preparation of compounds 1 in enantiomeri-
cally pure form. One method is based on selective
triﬂuoromethyl-containing aziridine ring-opening,13 while the
other involves triﬂuoromethylation of the intermediate imine
with CF3-SiMe3.14 Both approaches
reported signiﬁcant
breakthroughs, albeit
the multistep procedure limits their
synthetic value.

Consistent with our longstanding interests in the preparation
of ﬂuorine-containing biologically active compounds,15 we were
intrigued by the structure of triﬂuoromethyl-containing vicinal
diamines 1 and consequently developed an asymmetric
synthetic method for these compounds. Herein, we would
like to disclose experimental details, a mechanistic rationale for
the observed stereochemical outcome as well as
some
interesting chemical properties of 1-triﬂuoromethyl-1,2-dia-
mines 1.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“ques”>
In recent years, we were developing the chemistry of (Rs)- and
(Ss)-N-t-butylsulﬁnyl-3,3,3-triﬂuoroacetaldimine 416,17 (Scheme

−CH(NH2)−] pharmacophoric group18

into various organic compounds.19−22 On the basis of our
knowledge of sulﬁnyl-imine 4 reactivity, we envisioned that the
target vicinal diamines 1 can be obtained by the addition
reactions between 4 and aldimine 5.23 It was expected that

to react with sulﬁnyl-imine 4, giving the target Mannich-type
addition products. Unfortunately, our attempts to execute this
series of reactions failed, resulting in either no reaction or a
mixture of unidentiﬁed decomposition products.

Next, we prepared imine 825 (Reaction B) and conducted
series of the reactions with sulﬁnyl-imine 4. Application of
sterically bulky t-BuOLi, LDA, and LiHMDS gave no expected
products, while the use of n-BuLi gave us a breakthrough;
addition products 9a and 10a were isolated in 32% yield and
63/37 ratio. To further improve the reaction conditions, we
took a note of the recent discovery by the Zhao group26 on the
in situ decarboxylative generation of α-amino anion equivalents.
Also, we have reported several examples of various types of
decarboxylative generation of enolates and their reactions with

imines.27 Therefore, we decided to apply this method for
reactions with sulﬁnyl-imine 4 (Table 1). The whole procedure
(Table 1) includes the reaction of aldehyde 11 with lithium 2,2-
diphenylglycinate, to form the intermediate Schiﬀ bases 12,
followed by the decarboxylative Mannich addition with sulﬁnyl-
imine 4. It should be noted that the ﬁrst step of this process is a
quite rare example of a Schiﬀ base preparation under basic
conditions, requiring relatively strong bases and a prolonged
reaction time.28 The consequent reaction of Schiﬀ base 12a
with imines is rather novel and still mechanistically obscure.26
Our initial goals were to estimate the synthetic plausibility of
this approach, gauge the reactivity of imine 4, and optimize the
reaction conditions.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
Very surprisingly, we found that

the addition reaction
between Schiﬀ base 12a and imine 4, conducted in THF
without any additives, aﬀorded almost no product (entry 1).
Addition of organic bases, such as triethylamine (entry 2), also
provide almost no products. On the other hand, the addition of
20 mol % of benzoic acid (entry 3) to the reaction mixture gave
us a ﬁrst breakthrough in this study. The target products 9a and
10a were isolated in 35% yield but, most importantly, with
quite encouraging diastereoselectivity. Thus, considering that,
in the reactions under study, simultaneous formation of two
new stereogenic centers may give four stereoisomeric products,
we were very pleased to detect only two with a rather good
ratio of 96 to 4 (entry 3). Furthermore, the application of para-
nitrobenzoic acid as the additive, (entry 4) allowed us to
increase the yield (45%) and the diastereoselectivity (98/2).
Running the same reaction at ambient temperature (entry 5)
resulted in a bit
lower yield (39%) but excellent stereo-
selectivity (99/1), underscoring the synthetic potential of this
method. The use of less acidic para-methoxybenzoic acid (entry

in THF at 0 °C, did not cause any dramatic eﬀects,
6),
providing the formation of products 9a and 10a in yield (36%)
and with diastereoselectivity (98/2) well in line with previous
results. The higher yields were obtained when a greater excess
of the starting and Schiﬀ base 12a were used. For example, the
reaction conducted at 0 °C in THF using 1.6 equiv of 12a
(entry 7) gave rise to products 9a and 10a with noticeably
improved yield (50%) and the intact, good stereoselectivity.
Interestingly, carrying out
the same reaction at ambient
temperature (entry 8) resulted in synthetically acceptable
70% isolated yield of major diastereomer 9a. Further
improvement of the stereochemical outcome was made with
application of meta-nitrobenzoic acid as the additive. In this
case (entry 9), product 9a was isolated as a diastereomerically
pure compound in 74% yield.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
Next, we decided to screen some solvents to further improve
the chemical yields in these addition reactions. Unfortunately,
this idea was rather futile as the results presented in entries 10−
13 clearly suggest that THF is the solvent of choice. However,
the stereochemical outcome obtained in the reactions
conducted in DMF (entry 12) and DMSO (entry 13), albeit
very unsatisfactory, might have very important bearing on the
deduction of a plausible mechanism of these addition reactions.
Finally, we would like to mention here also the attempts to use
greater (entry 14) and lesser (entry 15) amounts of
the
additive, metal nature (Li vs K; entry 16), and a greater excess
of Schiﬀ base 12a (entry 17). All of these experiments did not
lead to improved chemical yields.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Then, we used the optimized reaction conditions to examine
the structural generality of these addition reactions. The data
obtained are summarized in Table 2. As the results presented in
Table 2 show,
in a series of monosubstituted benzaldehyde
derivatives 11b−m (entries 1−12), neither the nature of the
substituent, such as Me (entries 1, 4, 7), MeO (entries 2, 5, 8)
groups, or halogen atoms (Br: entries 3, 6, 11; Cl: entry 10; F:
entry 9; I: entry 12), nor the position on the aromatic ring
(ortho: entries 1−3; meta: entries 4−6; para: entries 7−12) has
an apparent eﬀect on the stereochemical outcome of these
Mannich additions. In the case of disubstituted substrates 11n−
p, the reactions took place also quite smoothly, aﬀording
products 9n−p in good chemical yields (entries 13−15).
Among other structurally interesting substrates, we investigated
the reactions of substrates containing ester (11q, entry 16),
diphenyl (11r, entry 17), and (E)-styryl (11s, entry 18)
moieties. These additions proceeded without any complica-
tions, giving rise to the expected products 9q−s
in
diastereomerically pure form. Here, we would like also to
tert-butyl-containing substrate 11t,
mention the reaction of
which failed to react with imine 4 (entry 19), most likely, due
to the vast steric bulk of a tert-butyl group. Albeit unsuccessful,
this result was important to draw the structural limitations of
this approach as well as provide valuable mechanistic clues.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Since four diﬀerent diastereomeric products [(1S,2S)(Ss),
(1R,2S)(Ss), (1S,2R)(Ss), (1R,2R)(Ss)] could be formed in this
reaction, we felt it was necessary to carry out crystallographic
analysis of both major and minor products. Taking advantage of
the high crystallinity of compounds 10a (minor diastereomer),
ring, and 9j (major
containing an unsubstituted phenyl
diastereomer), possessing a para-ﬂuoro-phenyl group, we
performed their single-crystal X-ray analysis (see the Support-
ing Information). According to the data obtained,
the
stereochemistry of major product 9j is (1S,2R)(Ss), while the
minor diastereomer 10a is of (1S,2S)(Ss) absolute conﬁg-

strong preference for the observed (1S)-conﬁguration is quite
consistent with the previously reported data.16,17,19−22 On the

the orthogonal protection of amino groups in 15, we performed
chemo-selective deprotection of the N-Boc group, aﬀording

<para sub=“ques”>
As mentioned above, the mechanism of these decarboxylative
Mannich addition reactions is obscure.26 For example, the
mode and order of the decarboxylation step and the role of the
acidic additives are particularly puzzling. This work has clearly
conﬁrmed the signiﬁcant eﬀect of the additives. Furthermore,
our new data have pointed to the critical role of the reaction
solvent inﬂuencing dramatically the stereochemical outcome
(Table 1, entries 12 and 13). Taking into account these factors
as well as principles of geometric homogeneity31 and minimum
charge separation,32 we were in the position to propose a
plausible mechanistic rationale to account for the observed
experimental results. One of the most important ﬁndings of this
work is a low diastereoselectivity obtained from the reactions of
lithiated derivatives of imine 8 (Scheme 2, Reaction B). To
rationalize this stereochemical outcome, we can build transition
states (TSs) A−C (Figure 1) leading to the products of (1S,2R)
absolute conﬁguration and TSs D−F responsible for
the
(1S,2S) stereochemistry of the minor diastereomers.
</para>
<para sub=“ques”>
Considering the mode of stereochemical interactions in TSs
A−C, we can suggest that TS C is the most favorable, placing
the stereocontrolling triﬂuoromethyl group33 in the least
sterically congested position (CF3/H/N vs CF3/N/Ph and
</para>

CF3/H/Ph). Interestingly, the same type of stereochemical
contacts can be found in a series of TSs D−F aﬀording
diastereomers with the opposite conﬁguration at C2. On the
basis of the same reasoning, TS F might be preferred over TSs
D and E. Overall, among the TSs A−F, there are no apparent
structural features to expect a great degree of stereochemical
preferences and high diastereoselectivity. Therefore,
the
observed low stereoselectivity, about 1/2 ratio of diastereomers
9a and 10a (Scheme 2), is rather adequate.
</para>
<para sub=“ques”>
These considerations lead us to a conclusion that the very
high level of diastereoselectivity obtained in the reactions of
Schiﬀ bases 12a with imine 4 (Tables 1 and 2) might involve
very diﬀerent reaction species. Bearing this in mind, we would
like to propose that the decarboxylative step occurs after or
simultaneously with the asymmetric C−C bond formation via
TSs G−I (Figure 2).
</para>
Figure 2. Possible TSs G−I in the reactions of Schiﬀ bases 12a with
imine 4.
<para sub=“ques”>
In the design of TSs G−I, we incorporated the following
assumptions: ﬁrst, Schiﬀ base 12a reacts in protonated form to
explain the crucial role of the acidic additives. Second, imine 4
reacts in the s-cis conformation,29 consistent with the α-(S)
absolute conﬁguration of the major products.19−22 Third, Schiﬀ
bases 12a react in (E) conformation with the glycine moiety
being hydrogen-bonded to form the ﬁve-membered ring.34 The
latter assumption can explain the critical role of the reaction
solvent as application of strongly polar DMF and DMSO
interfere with the
(Table 1, entries 12 and 13) might
intramolecular hydrogen bond.
Careful examination of TSs G−I allows us to note that TS I
has the most sterically favorable position of the CF3 group
(CF3/H/N vs CF3/N/Ph and CF3/H/Ph). However, most
importantly, in TS I, the transfer of hydrogen can take place
with a minimum charge separation from the glycine moiety to
the imine 4 nitrogen. This structural feature renders TS I most
plausible and explains all experimental facts encountered in this
study.

■ CONCLUSION

the results reported in this work evidently
To conclude,
demonstrate that
the decarboxylative Mannich addition
reactions between (Ss)-N-t-butylsulﬁnyl-3,3,3-triﬂuoro-
acetaldimine and Schiﬀ bases derived from various aldehydes
and lithium 2,2-diphenylglycinate represent a practical method
for preparation of triﬂuoromethyl-containing vicinal diamines
of high pharmaceutical potential. The reactions can be
conducted under operationally convenient conditions35 in
good yields and diastereoselectivities. The method is clearly
synthetically superior over the literature approaches and can be
of immediate use for reliable preparation of the triﬂuoromethyl-
containing vicinal diamines for synthetic and biological studies.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
Typical Procedure for the Asymmetric Decarboxylative
Mannich Addition Reactions. Schiﬀ base lithium salts were
synthesized according to the literature.26b To a 25 mL vial equipped
with a magnetic stirrer bar were added 2,2-diphenylglycine (0.3000 g,
1.32 mmol), t-BuOLi (0.1057 g, 1.32 mmol), and 3 Å molecular sieves
(0.30 g). The sealed vial was evacuated and reﬁlled with N2 three
times, followed by addition of anhydrous methanol (1.5 mL). After the
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 30 min, benzaldehyde
(0.1400 g, 1.32 mmol) was added. After stirring at room temperature
for 24 h, the reaction mixture was submitted to ﬁltration. The solid
was washed with anhydrous methanol (3 mL × 3). The combined
ﬁltrate was concentrated via rotary evaporation at 50 °C under
reduced pressure to give a white solid. The solid was further vacuumed
by an oil pump for 2 h. To the solid were added m-nitrobenzoic acid
(0.0277 g, 0.166 mmol), CF3-sulﬁnylimine (0.1670 g, 0.83 mmol), and
anhydrous THF (5.0 mL). The mixture was stirred under a N2
atmosphere at room temperature for 5 h and quenched with H2O (5
mL). The organic layer was taken, and the aqueous layer was extracted
with EtOAc (2 × 20 mL). The combined organic layers were washed
with water (2 × 30 mL) and brine solution (1 × 30 mL) and dried
over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated, and the crude
mixture was charged onto silica gel and puriﬁed through ﬂash
chromatography (elute: PE/EtOAc = 4:1) to furnish the correspond-
ing products 9, 10.

Procedure for Deprotection of 9s. Cleavage of the protecting
groups of diphenylketimine and chiral tert-butylsulﬁnyl was carried out
in a 25 mL round-bottom ﬂask where 9s (0.2493 g, 0.5 mmol) and
MeOH (5 mL) were added. Then, aqueous HCl (36%, 1.0 mL) was
added dropwise with stirring at room temperature. After 3 h, when the
reaction was completed by monitoring of the TLC, volatiles were
removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in
CH2Cl2 (10 mL), and Et3N (15.0 mmol) was added. The mixture was
stirred at rt for 1 h, and then H2O (10 mL) was added. The organic
layer was taken, washed with water and brine, and dried with
anhydrous Na2SO4. The mixture was ﬁltered and concentrated. The
crude product was puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography on silica gel
(elute: PE/EA/TEA = 50:50:1) to give the product free vicinal
diamine 13 in 86% yield.
