ABSTRACT: A vanadium−binaphthylbishydroxamic acid
(BBHA) complex-catalyzed asymmetric epoxidation of allylic
alcohols is described. The optically active binaphthyl-based
ligands BBHA 2a and 2b were synthesized from (S)-1,1′-
binaphthyl-2,2′-dicarboxylic acid and N-substituted-O-trime-
thylsilyl (TMS)-protected hydroxylamines via a one-pot, three-
step procedure. The epoxidations of 2,3,3-trisubstituted allylic
alcohols using the vanadium complex of 2a were easily
performed in toluene with a TBHP water solution to aﬀord
(2R)-epoxy alcohols in good to excellent enantioselectivities.

■ INTRODUCTION

independent of

the allylic alcohols. Therefore,

The asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols is an attractive
method for the synthesis of chiral epoxy alcohols, which are
useful chiral building blocks for the production of pharmaceut-
icals and agrochemicals.1 The Katsuki−Sharpless asymmetric
epoxidation of allylic alcohols is a reliable method of obtaining
synthetically useful chiral epoxy alcohols.2 The epoxidation
gives very high asymmetric induction for various types of allylic
alcohols. The enantioselectivity depends only on the chirality of
L-(+)-, or D-(−)-tartrates as ligands,
the
structure of
the absolute
conﬁguration of the products can be predicted. Although the
epoxidation is conducted using commercially available titanium
tartrate, and tert-butylhydroperoxide
tetraisopropoxide,
it requires strict anhydrous
(TBHP) as an oxidizing agent,
conditions.
Recently, the vanadium−chiral hydroxamic acid (V−HA)
complex-catalyzed asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols
with TBHP has also become a highly potent approach to
obtaining chiral epoxy alcohols. The advantage of the V−HA
complex-catalyzed method is its simple reaction procedure,
which can be conducted in aqueous TBHP solution, rather than
under anhydrous conditions. Since the ﬁrst
report by
Sharpless,3 the V−HA complex-catalyzed system has been
extensively studied for the past decade.4−7 Yamamoto has
reported C2-symmetric cyclohexane diamine-based chiral
bishydroxamic acid (BHA) ligands.8 The vanadium−BHA
system exhibited excellent enantioselectivities for a wide
range of substituted allylic alcohols. The recent application of
BHA ligands for Mo-, Zr-, Hf-, and W-catalyzed systems
demonstrated that the C2-symmetric chiral BHA ligand was
very useful
for asymmetric oxidations of sulﬁdes, simple
alkenes, homoallylic alcohols, and allylic amine derivatives.9

Axially chiral C2-symmetric binaphthyl derivatives have been
recognized as a privileged chiral
ligand for many enantiose-
lective reactions.10 The C2-symmetric chiral auxiliaries minimize
the possibility of diastereomeric interactions at the transition
state and are therefore useful for obtaining high enantiomeric
excesses and for elucidating the mechanism of asymmetric
induction.11 The steric bulkiness and structural rigidity of
naphthalene rings would be eﬀective for the production of large
asymmetric space. The ﬂexibility of the binaphthyl axis enables
the chiral ligand to adapt to a wide range of substrates. This
induced-fit property12 would also be a great advantage for the
the vanadium−
asymmetric reaction. Herein, we report
binaphthylbishydroxamic acid (BBHA) complex-catalyzed
asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub="scope">
The BBHA ligands were synthesized via a one-pot, three-step
procedure. The method involved (i) the preparation of the acid
chloride of (S)-1,1′-binaphthyl-2,2′-dicarboxylic acid13 (1)
followed by (ii) the reaction of the N-substituted-O-TMS
protected hydroxylamines and then (iii) the removal of the
TMS groups from the amide. Chromatographic puriﬁcation and
recrystallization gave pure BBHA ligands 2a and 2b in 65% and
54% chemical yields from (S)-1 (Scheme 1).

1H NMR spectra of 2a and 2b in CDCl3 at

structural rigidity of the amide linkage and hydrogen bonding.
Therefore, most of the 13C NMR signals of 2a and 2b were not
observed. NMR measurements at 80 °C improved the situation
with regard to the broad signals in the 1H and 13C spectra of 2a
and 2b. However, the structure assignments on the basis of the

aromatic NMR signals remained diﬃcult. Consequently, single-
crystal X-ray diﬀraction analysis was used to ascertain the
structure and conformation of BBHA ligands 2a and 2b.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
A single crystal of 2a was obtained by slow evaporation from
toluene solution at room temperature. Similarly, a single crystal
of 2b was prepared from EtOH−THF solution. The molecular
structures of 2a and 2b were determined by single-crystal X-ray
diﬀraction analysis.14 The crystal prepared from 2a contained
one toluene molecule per 2a. The dihedral angle of
the
binaphthyl axis, C2−C1−C1′−C2′, of 2a and 2b was 85° and
70°, respectively. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the
carbonyl oxygen and hydroxyl group were observed in both
structures, and the oxygen−oxygen distances were 2.6−2.7 Å.
In the crystal of 2a with toluene, the hydroxamic acid moieties
were transoid structures, and the torsional angles of HO−N−
CO were 170° and 175°. In contrast, cisoid and transoid
structures were observed in the crystal structure of 2b, and the
torsional angles were 14° and 167°, respectively. The cisoid
hydroxamic groups formed intramolecular stacking structures
between the naphthalene and benzene rings.15 BBHA 2a
appears to have a larger asymmetric space than 2b, and we
employed 2a for
the asymmetric
epoxidation.

To optimize the epoxidation conditions using BBHA 2a,
allylic alcohol 3a was used as a model substrate. The vanadium/
ligand ratio,
solvent, and vanadium compounds were
investigated using 5 mol % of the vanadium compound; the
results are reported in Table 1. A typical reaction procedure was
as follows: BBHA 2a and 5 mol % of vanadium compound were
stirred in the solvent at 20 °C for 24 h, whereupon 1.5 equiv of
TBHP water solution and then allylic alcohol 3a were added.
The mixture was
the complete
consumption of allylic alcohol 3a or 24 h of reaction time.
The reaction was then quenched by adding saturated aqueous
Na2SO3 solution; subsequent extraction and chromatographic
puriﬁcation gave epoxy alcohol 4a and recovered 3a. The
enantiomeric excess (ee) was determined by chiral-stationary-
phase HPLC analysis. The absolute stereochemistry of
(2R,3R)-4a was determined by comparison of the chiroptical
property with the literature data.16

The vanadium/ligand ratio for the best asymmetric induction
was examined via the reactions described in entries 1−3.
Generally, one hydroxamic acid group (CO−NOH) serves
as one bidentate ligand using two oxygen atoms of carbonyl and
hydroxyl groups. Because BBHA 2a has two hydroxamic acids
and might be potentially tetradendate, we examined the
optimum molar amount of BBHA for 5 mol % of VO(OEt)3

VO(OEt)3) gave better asymmetric induction of 86% ee
(entries 1 and 2) than the quantities used in entry 3. Allylic
alcohol 3a was recovered in entries 1 and 2; thus, the reaction
proceeded more slowly in the cases of entries 1 and 2 than in
the case of entry 3. The vanadium excess condition in entry 3,
VO(OEt)3 5 mol % and BBHA 3 mol % (potentially 6 mol % of
coordination sites), appeared to produce ligand-free vanadium
species, which resulted in racemic epoxy alcohol 4a with
improved yield and decreased enantioselectivity. We therefore
chose the best ratio of 7.5 mol % BBHA for 5 mol % of
vanadium.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
Next, the solvent eﬀect was examined using an excess-ligand
condition: 5 mol % of VO(OEt)3 and 7.5 mol % of BBHA 2a.
The epoxidation proceeded rapidly in CHCl3 and CH2Cl2,
moderately in toluene and EtOAc, and slowly in acetonitrile
and acetone (entries 4−8). A considerable amount of allylic
alcohol 3a was recovered from the reactions in EtOAc,
acetonitrile, and acetone. The best enantioselectivity was
observed in toluene in the reaction involving VO(OEt)3
(entries 2 and 4−7). A similar tendency was observed in the
solvent screening reaction involving VO(acac)2 (entries 9−11).
VO(acac)2 is an inexpensive, air-stable, and easy-to-handle solid
reagent. Toluene was also the best solvent for the combination
of 2a and VO(acac)2. A comparison of
the vanadium
compounds revealed that VO(acac)2 exhibited slightly better
enantioselectivity than VO(OEt)3 or VO(Oi-Pr)3 (entries 2, 9,
and 12). Further optimization of reaction conditions was
conducted with 5 mol % of VO(acac)2 and 7.5 mol % of BBHA
2a in toluene. The complexation time, oxidant, concentration,
and equivalents of TBHP were examined;
the results are
summarized in Table 2.

was examined for convenience of epoxidation. Nearly the same
change in color was observed at 3 h (entry 3), and the ee of the
epoxide 4a was the same as that for 24 h. Three hours was
for the complexation of 2a to obtain the best
suﬃcient
enantioselectivity in toluene solution at 20 °C (entries 1−3).
Hydroperoxide species were investigated (entries 3−5) under
these complexation conditions. The use of a water solution or
nonane solution of TBHP gave the same ee of 89%. The use of
the nonane solution of TBHP required a longer reaction time
of 24 h for the consumption of allylic alcohol 3a (entry 4). The
epoxidation employing cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) in
aromatic hydrocarbon proceeded more slowly, and the
enantioselectivity slightly decreased (entry 5). Compared to
the epoxidation at 20 °C (entry 3), reaction at the lower
temperature of 0 °C improved the enantioselectivity to 92% ee
(entry 6). Next, the substrate concentration and equivalents of
TBHP were examined. Higher substrate concentrations (0.1 vs.
0.25−1 mol/L) did not improve the yields (entries 6 vs. 7−9),
whereas excess TBHP (3 equiv) slightly improved the yields
(entries 9−10). Under TBHP (3 equiv) conditions, no
inﬂuence of
substrate concentration on the yield and
enantioselectivity was observed (entries 10 and 11). On the
basis of the best epoxidation condition in entry 11 (87% yield,
92% ee), more ligand-eﬃcient conditions were re-examined.
The molar ratio of VO(acac)2/BBHA 2a was changed from 5/
7.5 to 5/5.5. Unfortunately, enantioselectivity was decreased to
89% ee, whereas the yield was increased to 93% in 24 h.

<para sub="scope">
The substrate scope of the epoxidation was examined under
the optimized reaction conditions (Table 2, entry11) using
BBHA 2a with a complexation time of 3 h. The results are
summarized in Table 3. The ee was determined by chiral-
stationary-phase HPLC analysis. For the HPLC analysis of
aliphatic epoxy alcohols 4f−4k,
the epoxy alcohols were
converted into benzoate derivatives. The absolute stereo-
chemistry of the epoxide was determined by comparison of the
chiroptical properties with the literature data.

In the case of

The epoxidation of trisubstituted allylic alcohols proceeded
faster than the epoxidation of disubstituted allylic alcohols
(entries 1 and 3 vs entries 4−6 and entries 8−11 vs entries 12−
13). Although the chemical reactivity of the vanadium complex
of BBHA 2b was almost the same as the chemical reactivity of
BBHA 2a, enantioselectivity was low for the epoxidation of 3a
(entry 1−2).
the epoxidation of geminal
substituted allylic alcohol 3e, the opposite enantiomer of (S)-4e
was obtained when BBHA 2b was used in the reaction (entries
6−7). The enantioselectivity of the epoxidation was better in
the case of the reaction of trisubstituted allylic alcohols than in
the case of disubstituted allylic alcohols (entries 1 and 3 vs
entries 4−6). In the reaction of disubstituted allylic alcohols,
enantioselectivity of the epoxidation increased in the order
geminal < trans < cis with respect to the geometry of the oleﬁn
moiety (entries 4−6 and 12−13). Epoxidation of a bulky
trisubstituted allylic alcohol, geraniol (3f), showed excellent
enantioselectivity and gave epoxide 4f in 98% ee (entry 8).17 In
the epoxidation of geraniol (3f) and nerol (3g), allylic alcohol
moieties were predominantly epoxidized over the trisubstituted
alkene moieties, and no overoxidized products were obtained
(entries 8 and 9). The epoxidation of low-molecular-weight
allylic alcohol 3h proceeded with good enantioselectivity to give
epoxy alcohol 4h (entry 10). The use of (S)-conﬁgured BBHA
2a gave (2R)-epoxy alcohols as the major enantiomers in all
cases.

■ CONCLUSIONS

We observed that binaphthyl-based BBHA 2a was an eﬀective
ligand for the vanadium-catalyzed asymmetric epoxidation of
allylic alcohols. The (S)-BBHA ligands were easily synthesized
by the one-pot, three-step procedure from (S)-1,1′-binaphthyl-
2,2′-dicarboxylic acid. The combination of
the stable and
inexpensive VO(acac)2 and a TBHP water solution as the
oxidant
in toluene gave the epoxy alcohols in the best
enantioselectivities. The reaction proceeded faster for trisub-

Synthesis of Allylic Alcohols: (E)-2,3-Diphenyl-2-propen-1-ol
(3b).22 A mixture of (E)-2,3-diphenyl-2-propenoic acid (3.02 g, 13.4
mmol) and powdered KOH (1.24 g, 18.7 mmol) in DMSO (40 mL)
was stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture was cooled to 0
°C, whereupon MeI (1.25 mL, 20.1 mmol) was added, and the
resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 42 h. Water (100
mL) was added, and the mixture was extracted with n-hexane/EtOAc
(1:1) (100 mL × 3). The combined organic layer was washed with
water (100 mL × 3), dried over MgSO4, and ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was
concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was puriﬁed
by column chromatography (silica gel, 0−4% EtOAc/n-hexane) to
give methyl (E)-2,3-diphenyl-2-propenoate (2.97 g, 92%) as a
colorless solid: Rf = 0.22 (silica gel, EtOAc/n-hexane = 1:40). 1H

To a solution of (E)-2,3-diphenyl-2-propenoate (2.67 g, 11.2
mmol) in Et2O (22 mL) was added DIBAL solution (0.98 mol/L in
hexanes, 25.2 mL, 46.2 mmol) at 0 °C over 20 min. The mixture was
warmed to room temperature and stirred for 4 h. The mixture was
then recooled to 0 °C, and water (100 mL) was carefully added,
followed by brine (50 mL). The white solid that formed was dissolved
by the addition of 2 mol/L aqueous HCl. The resulting mixture was
extracted with Et2O (150 mL × 3). The combined organic layer was
washed with brine (100 mL), dried over MgSO4, and ﬁltered. The
ﬁltrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product
was puriﬁed by column chromatography (silica gel, 5−32% EtOAc/n-
hexane) to give allylic alcohol 3b (2.13 g, 90%) as a colorless oil: Rf =

Typical Procedure for the Asymmetric Epoxidation: Epox-
idation of 3a (Table 3, Entry 1). A mixture of VO(acac)2 (6.62 mg,
25.0 μmol) and BBHA 2a (20.7 mg, 37.5 μmol) in toluene (5.00 mL)
was stirred at 20 °C for 3 h. To the resulting dark-purple solution,
TBHP in water (70%, 206 μL, 1.5 mmol, 3.0 equiv) was added at 0
°C; the resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min. Allylic alcohol 3a
(74.6 mg, 500 μmol) was added, and the reaction was monitored by
TLC. Saturated aqueous Na2SO3 solution was added. The mixture was
stirred for 30 min and extracted with Et2O or EtOAc (5 mL × 5). The
combined organic layer was dried over MgSO4 and ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate
was concentrated under vacuum. The crude product was puriﬁed by
column chromatography (silica gel, 5−40% EtOAc/n-hexane) to give
epoxy alcohol 4a as colorless needles (72.3 mg, 87%). HPLC analysis
of 4a indicated 92% ee. To isolate the volatile aliphatic epoxy alcohols
(4h, 4j, and 4k), a partially concentrated solution of crude epoxy
alcohols, mostly in toluene, was charged directly to the column for
chromatography. Al2O3 (activity III) was used instead of silica gel for
the puriﬁcation of epoxy alcohols 4d, 4f, 4g, 4h, 4i, 4j, and 4k.
Benzoylation and m-Toluoylation of Aliphatic Epoxy
Alcohols (4f−4k). To a CH2Cl2 (0.25 mol/L) solution of epoxy
alcohol 4f−4k (1 equiv), DMAP (2 mol %), and NEt3 (3 equiv) was
added RCOCl (1.2 equiv) at 0 °C. The mixture was gradually warmed
to room temperature and stirred for 5 h. Saturated aqueous NaHCO3
was added, and the organic layer was extracted with CH2Cl2. The
extracts were dried over MgSO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated. The crude
ester was puriﬁed by column chromatography (silica gel, EtOAc/n-
hexane or EtOAc/n-hexane/CH2Cl2) to give esters of 4f−4h-benzoyl
and 4i−4k-toluoyl.

(17) The enantioselectivity of the epoxidation using BBHA 2a was
generally lower than those using Yamamoto’s BHA ligands,8a,c but one
example of epoxidation of geraniol (3f) showed a similar level of
enantioselectivity.
