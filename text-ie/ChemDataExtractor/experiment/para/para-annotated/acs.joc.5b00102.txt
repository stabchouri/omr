ABSTRACT: The reductive coupling of aliphatic esters with
benzophenones by Zn−TiCl4 in THF gave two- and four-electron
reduced products, diaryl(hydroxy)methyl ketones, and diarylmethyl
ketones selectively by controlling the reaction conditions. In the
reaction of aromatic esters with benzophenones, diarylmethyl
ketones were obtained as the sole products. N-(Alkoxycarbonyl)-(S)-α-amino acid methyl esters gave optically active
diphenylmethyl ketones by reduction with benzophenone. The obtained diphenylmethyl ketones were transformed to 4,5-cis-
disubstituted oxazolidin-2-ones stereoselectively.

■ INTRODUCTION

Reductive cross-coupling of carboxylic acid derivatives with
ketones is a potent tool for the reductive acylation of ketones to
synthesize larger ketones. Of the carboxylic acid derivatives,
esters are the most convenient substrates since they are readily
accessible and relatively inert. The reductive cross-coupling of
esters with ketones have been realized using low-valent
titanium as a reducing agent.1 In these cases, the products
were four-electron reduced ketones (Scheme 1).2 On the other

hand, this type of coupling was also eﬀected with SmI2
electroreduction4 to give two-electron reduced α-hydroxy
ketones. Recently, we reported the reductive coupling of 1,3-
dimethyluracils, N-methoxycarbonyl
lactams, and aliphatic
cyclic imides with benzophenones by low-valent
titanium
generated from Zn−TiCl4 and found that
two- and four-
electron reduced products were both obtained selectively by
controlling the reaction conditions.5 These results prompted us

the reductive coupling of aromatic

this reductive coupling provides a useful method for the
preparation of diarylmethyl ketones. The synthesis of diary-

α-amino acid methyl esters as aliphatic esters to extend the
scope of the reductive coupling of esters with benzophenones.
From the obtained diphenylmethyl ketones, optically active 4,5-

the product yields based on 2a were optimized. In the previous
reports,2 the reductions were performed with more than 2
equiv of low-valent titanium in reﬂuxing THF. Therefore, we
initially investigated the reductive coupling of 1a with 2a using
equimolar amounts of low-valent titanium at ambient temper-
ature. The molar ratio of Zn/TiCl4 was ﬁxed to 2/1 throughout
this study. First, the reaction was carried out with a molar ratio
of 1a/2a/TiCl4 of 1/1/1 in THF at 25 °C for 2 h, and then 1-
hydroxy-1,1-diphenylbutan-2-one (3a) was obtained as the
two-electron reduced product in 64% yield together with a
small amount (2%) of
reduced product 1,1-
diphenylbutan-2-one (4a) (run 1). The yield of 3a increased
to 72% and 70% with an increased molar ratio of 1a/2a from 1/
1 to 2/1 and 3/1, respectively (runs 2 and 3). These results
show that the 2/1 molar ratio of 1a/2a was suﬃcient to obtain
3a. Next, to obtain 4a predominantly, the reaction was carried
out with a molar ratio of 1a/2a/TiCl4 as 2/1/2 at 50 °C for 2 h
(run 4). Although the yield of 4a (45%) was much higher than
that of 3a (5%), a considerable amount (40%) of homocoupled
product of 2a, 1,1,2,2-tetraphenylethene, was formed at this
temperature. Nevertheless, the further reduction to 4a seemed
to be slow at 25 °C (run 5). Thus, the reaction was performed
at 25 °C for 2 h and then continued at 50 °C for 2 h (run 6).
The desired 4a was produced in 77% yield with a small amount
of 3a (6%). Furthermore, the prolonged reaction time (6 h) at
50 °C completed the reduction of 3a to 4a (80%) (run 7).

THF at 25 °C for 6 h, and 1,2,2-triphenylethanone (7a) was
obtained as the four-electron reduced product in 33% yield
(run 1). In this case, 6a and 2a were recovered in 65% and 35%
recovery rates, respectively. To complete the reaction, the
amount of reducing agent was doubled (6a/2a/TiCl4 = 1/1/2)
(run 2). Although 2a was completely consumed (54% yield of
7a), 33% of 6a was recovered unreacted. Therefore,
the
reaction was carried out with a molar ratio of 6a/2a/TiCl4 as 1/
2/3 (run 3). As expected, almost all of 6a was consumed and 7a
was obtained in 72% yield. When the reaction was performed at

Therefore, the molar ratio of 2a and TiCl4 against 8c was

10c increased to 68%, and the recovery of 8c decreased to less

platinum cathode showed ﬁrst reduction peaks at −1.90 vs
SCE, whereas those of 1a and 6a under the same conditions
revealed no reduction peak from 0 to −2.5 V vs SCE. These
results suggest that this reductive coupling is initiated by the
reduction of 2a. Initially, 2a is reduced by two-electron transfer
from low-valent titanium to give titanate A. The nucleophilic
addition of A to an ester produces adduct B. When the ester is
aliphatic (R = alkyl), the workup of B with water at 25 °C gives
3 since the adduct B is stable at this temperature. On the other
two-electron reduction of B by low-valent
hand,
titanium proceeds at 50 °C to aﬀord enolate C, which is
hydrolyzed to diphenylmethyl ketone 4. When the ester is
aromatic (R = aryl), adduct B is immediately reduced to C even
at 25 °C since enolate C is additionally stabilized by the aryl
group. Hence, diphenylmethyl aryl ketones 7 were the only
products and diphenyl(hydroxy)methyl aryl ketones corre-
sponding to 3 could not be detected as described above.

4. Reductive Coupling of N-Alkoxycarbonyl α-Amino
Acid Methyl Esters with Benzophenone by Zn−TiCl4.
The reduction with benzophenone (2a) was attempted by
employing N-Cbz- and N-Moc-(S)-proline methyl esters (8a
and 8b) as aliphatic esters
to prepare optically active
diphenylmethyl ketones, and the results are summarized in
Table 7, in which the yields based on more valuable esters 8a,b
were optimized. The reduction was carried out with the molar
ratio of 8a/2a/TiCl4 as 1/1/1 at 25 °C for 2 h according as run
1 in Table 1. The two- and four-electron reduced products 9a
(10%) and 10a (14%) were obtained in poor yields, and a
signiﬁcant amount (72%) of 8a was recovered since 8a was a
sterically hindered ester (run 1). In addition, this result shows
that it is diﬃcult to control the further reduction of 9a to 10a at
25 °C. Therefore, the reaction was performed with a molar
ratio of 8a/2a/TiCl4 of 1/2/3 under the same conditions as run
3 in Table 5 to obtain 10a primarily (run 2). Since an
unignorable amount of 8a (38%) and a small amount of 9a
(8%) still remained, the molar ratio of 2a and TiCl4 against 8a
increased twice (8a/2a/TiCl4 as 1/4/6) (run 3).

Moreover, the reaction was carried out at 25 °C for 2 h and
subsequently at 50 °C for 1 h, and 10a was obtained in 72%
yield (run 4). Similarly, the reaction of 8b with 2a under the
same conditions as run 4 aﬀorded 10b in 69% yield (run 6).

recrystallization,
its single crystal could not be acquired.
Similarly to 11a, the cis conﬁguration of the major isomer of
11b was conﬁrmed by X-ray crystallography of that of rac-11b.
The optical purity of cis-11b was determined to be 96% ee by
1H NMR spectra with Eu(hfc)3. However, the reduction of 10d
with L-Selectride did not proceed at all, probably due to the
high bulkiness of 10d. Alternatively, the reduction of 10d with
LiBHEt3 at −20 °C and following cyclization gave 11c in 74%
yield with a 97/3 of cis/trans ratio. The major isomer of 11c
was assigned to be cis by the correlation of 1H NMR spectra
between 11b and 11c as shown in Table 9. The optical purity
of cis-11c was determined to be 98% ee by 1H NMR spectra

electron reduced products, diarylmethyl ketones 4a−f. The
both of two- and four-electron reduced products could be
obtained selectively by controlling the amounts of Zn−TiCl4
and reaction temperature. In the reaction of aliphatic lactones
1g−i with benzophenone 2a, two-electron reduced products
3g,h and four-electron reduced products 5 and 4h,i were also
obtained selectively by controlling the reaction conditions. On
the other hand, the reductive coupling of aromatic esters 6a−h
with 2a−d aﬀorded four-electron reduced products, diary-
lmethyl ketones 7a−k, as the sole products irrespective of the
reaction conditions. In addition, optically active diphenylmethyl
ketones 10a−d were prepared by the reductive coupling of N-
(alkoxycarbonyl)-α-amino acid methyl esters 8a−d with 2a.
From 8a−d, optically active 4,5-cis-disubstituted oxazolidin-2-
ones 11a−c were synthesized by selective reduction and
following cyclization.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Methods. Column chromatography was performed on
silica gel 60. THF was distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl
radical.

Typical Procedure of Reductive Coupling by Ti-ZnCl4. To a
solution of 1a (0.20 mL, 2 mmol), 2a (182 mg, 1 mmol), and zinc
powder (0.13 g, 2 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was added TiCl4 (0.11 mL,
1 mmol) dropwise at 0 °C, and then the dark blue suspension was
stirred for 2 h at 25 °C. To the mixture was added 1 M HCl (20 mL),
and the mixture was stirred for 10 min at 25 °C. The mixture was
extracted with ethyl acetate three times. The organic layer was washed
with aqueous NaCl and dried over MgSO4. After the solvent was
removed, the residue was puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica
gel to give 3a in 72% yield (173 mg) with small amounts of 4a (11 mg,
5%). Compounds 3a,7 3b,6,7 3c,3,7 3e,6,7 3f,6 4a,9f,10a 4b,13,14 4c,8a,15

Transformarion of 10a to 11a. To a solution of 10a (100 mg,
0.25 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was added 1 M L-Selectride in THF (0.5
mL, 0.5 mmol) at −50 °C. After being stirred at this temperature for 6
h, the mixture was diluted with 0.5 M HCl (10 mL) and extracted with
ethyl acetate three times. The organic layer was washed with aqueous
NaCl and dried over MgSO4. After the solvent was removed, the
residue was reﬂuxed in MeOH (5 mL) containing K2CO3 (35 mg, 0.25
mmol) for 2 h. After the solvent was removed in vacuo, the residue
was puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel to give 11a in
63% yield (46 mg).
