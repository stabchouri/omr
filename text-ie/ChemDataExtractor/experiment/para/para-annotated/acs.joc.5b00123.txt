ABSTRACT: Air oxidative radical hydroxysulfurization of styrenes initiated by 0.5 mol
% of
tert-butyl hydroperoxide with arylthiols is described, and a new type of
difunctionalization of alkenes was achieved.

D ifunctionalization has become a powerful tool in modern

synthetic chemistry.1 The radical difunctionalization
reaction has attracted more attention in recent years because
of its mild conditions, high selectivity, and convenient workup.2
Thiol−oxygen co-oxidation (TOCO) of oleﬁns ﬁrst reported
by Kharasch in 19513 is a well-known difunctionalization
reaction, usually initiated by UV irradiation or excess peroxides.
It has been widely applied to the synthesis of TOCO products
such as β-hydroperoxysulﬁdes and β-hydroxysulfoxides but not
β-hydroxysulﬁdes unless a reductant is added to the resultant
compound in situ (Scheme 1a).4 Hence, it is still a challenge to
prepare β-hydroxysulﬁdes directly by the TOCO reaction.

Scheme 1. Protocols for the Synthesis of β-Hydroxysulﬁdes

β-Hydroxysulﬁdes are important starting materials for the
synthesis of higher functionalized organic molecules,5 pharma-
ceuticals,6 and natural products.7 One of the most straightfor-
ward synthetic route to β-hydroxysulﬁdes is the reaction of
epoxides, commonly derived from alkenes, with thiols in the
presence of promoters and/or catalysts (Scheme 1b).5,8 These
methods are useful but suﬀer from some drawbacks, such as
drastic reaction conditions, poor regioselectivity, lower yields,
and undesirable byproducts.9 Recently, methods for synthesiz-
ing β-hydroxysulﬁdes via the reaction of alkenes with thiols
were developed by the groups of Rao and Kamal, and these

reactions were conducted in β-cyclodextrin/H2O10 or ionic
liquid [bmim][BF4]/H2O11 medium through a nonradical
process (Scheme 1c,d). Yadav et al. performed the same
reaction utilizing eosin Y as an organo-photo-redox catalyst in
the visible light region to aﬀord the exclusive β-ketosulfoxides.
The experiment conﬁrmed that the reaction proceeds via a
radical pathway.12 To the best of our knowledge, no work on
the direct one-pot synthesis of β-hydroxysulﬁdes via the TOCO
reaction has been reported. In continuation of our eﬀort on the
difunctionalization of alkenes,13 herein, we report a new radical
hydroxysulfurization of styrenes for the direct synthesis of β-
hydroxysulﬁdes based on the reaction of alkenes and arylthiols
initiated by 0.5 mol % of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)
(Scheme 1e).
<para sub=“opt”>
At the initial stage, the reaction of styrene 1a with thiophenol
2a in the presence of 0.5 mol % of TBHP was used as a model
reaction. Solvent screening indicated that
the reaction in
dimethylformamide (DMF) aﬀorded β-hydroxysulﬁde 3a as a
major product in 70% yield, accompanied by byproducts β-
oxosulﬁde 4a, benzaldehyde, and diphenyldisulﬁde (Table 1,
entry 5). Thus, using DMF as solvent, the ratio of 1a/2a,
TBHP loading, temperature, and time were screened (Table 1,
entries 10−21); optimum reaction conditions were determined
to be styrene (1a, 1.0 equiv) and thiophenol (2a, 2 equiv) in
DMF at 25 °C for 48 h (Table 1, entry 15) to aﬀord the
selective β-hydroxysulﬁde 3a in 74% yield.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Under the optimized reaction conditions, the reactions of a
variety of substituted styrenes 1 with thiophenol 2a were
carried out. Styrenes bearing Me, F, and Cl groups on the
ring were tolerated to aﬀord the selective β-
phenyl
hydroxysulﬁdes
in good yields although with prolonged
reaction time (Table 2, 3b,c and 3e,h). It is noteworthy that
the reaction of 4-methoxystyrene 1d gave the desired product
3d in slightly low yield; this may be attributed to some of 1d
being oxidized in the reaction. The reactions of styrenes bearing

strong electron-withdrawing groups such as CF3, COOCH3,

3k, 3l, and 3m), while no reaction was observed with the NO2
derivative (Table 2, 3n).

<para sub="scope">
To evaluate the eﬀect of α- or β-substituents of styrene on
the reaction, CH3-, Br-, and Ph-substituted styrenes were
utilized for this purpose. The reactions of α-methylstyrene 1o
and β-methylstyrene 1p with 2a aﬀorded the expected β-
hydroxysulﬁdes 3o and 3p in 57 and 41% yield, respectively
(Table 3, entries 1 and 2). It was noted that the methyl
substituent located at the α- or β-position of styrene has a steric
eﬀect on the reaction,
leading to the decreased yield of
products. Then the reaction of α-bromostyrene 1q with 2a was
carried out, and β-oxosulﬁde 4q was isolated in 44% yield
(Table 3, entry 3), while the reaction of β-bromostyrene 1r
with 2a gave the β-oxythioacetal 4r in 15% yield (Table 3, entry
4). Also, the reaction of α-phenylstyrene 1s with 2a was
performed, and the corresponding β-hydroxysulﬁde 3s was
isolated in 71% yield (Table 3, entry 5). On the contrary, no
reaction was observed for β-phenylstyrene 1t (Table 3, entry
6). On the basis of the results aforementioned, using α- or β-
substituted (CH3, Br, and Ph) styrenes as substrates, diﬀerent
products or yields were obtained, which depended on both the
type of substituents and their location. Finally, nonconjugated
terminal alkenes 1u,v were used in place of styrene, but no
reactions were observed (Table 3, entries 7 and 8).

With the promising results in hand,

the reaction was
extended to other arylthiols. The results indicated that the
type of substituents and their location had an eﬀect on the
outcome of the reaction. The reaction of o-tolylthiol 2b with
styrene 1a gave the desired β-hydroxysulﬁde 3ab in 92% yield,
while the o-methoxybenzenethiol 2c aﬀorded the β-oxosulﬁde
4ac in 16% yield. p-Methoxybenzenethiol 2e and o-amino-
benzenethiol 2f gave no desired β-hydroxysulﬁdes 3ae and 3af
(Table 4). The arylthiols bearing F and Cl groups reacted with
1a to aﬀord the expected β-hydroxysulﬁdes 3ag, 3ah, and 3ai in
moderate yields (Table 4), while the NO2 derivative did not
react (Table 4, 3aj). Also, no reactions were observed with
pyridylthiol and furylthiol (Table 4, 3ak and 3al).

Finally, the scale-up reaction of 1a (10.4 g, 0.1 mol) with 2a
(22.0 g, 0.2 mol) in DMF at room temperature for 48 h in the
presence of 0.5 mol % of TBHP was performed, and the
expected product 3a was obtained in 64% yield (14.7 g).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
To conﬁrm that the reaction proceeded via a radical pathway,
TEMPO was added to the reaction mixture of styrene 1a with
thiophenol 2a, and only product 5 was isolated, which was
conﬁrmed to be 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-((phenylthio)oxy)-
piperidine formed from the reaction of TEMPO and a
radical; however, no β-hydroxysulﬁde 3a was
thiophenyl
formed (Scheme 2). This result strongly supported the free
radical mechanism. On the basis of the results obtained, a
mechanism for the reaction of styrenes 1 with thiophenol 2a
was proposed in Scheme 2. Thiyl radical 6 initiated by TBHP
selectively adds to the terminal CC double bond of 1 to form
intermediate radical 7. It reacts with O2 to form peroxy radical
8, followed by reacting with 2a to form hydroperoxide 9, and
thiyl radical 6 is regenerated. 9 reacts with thiophenol 2a to give
radical 10, which then obtains a hydrogen atom from 2a to
aﬀord product 3 and to regenerate thiyl radical 6, which
continues to drive the reaction further.

fN.R.

In conclusion, a new type of difunctionalization of alkenes via
the reaction of arylthiols with styrenes has been developed. The
reaction was initiated by 0.5 mol % of TBHP at room
temperature, with air (O2) as the sole oxidant to aﬀord the
hydroxysulfurization products in moderate to good yields. The
reaction can be eﬀectively scaled up and the product
conveniently obtained in a one-pot process. This method is
straightforward, requires no additives or other oxidant, and
involves simple manipulations. The β-hydroxysulﬁdes obtained
can be directly applied in the syntheses of organic and
medicinal compounds and can also be transformed into a
variety of other useful functionalized compounds.
