ABSTRACT: The imitation of macroscopic movements at the
molecular level is a key step in the development of nanomachines.
The challenge is the synthesis of molecules that are able to
transform external stimuli into a direction-controlled mechanical
movement. The more complex such motion sequences are, the
more diﬃcult is the construction of the corresponding nano-
machine. Here, we present a system that demonstrates a
unidirectional,
similar
characteristics to the arm movements of a human breaststroke
swimmer. Like the latter, the molecules have a torso and two arms.
The arms consist of bipyridine units and can be folded and
stretched by addition and removal of copper
ions. The
unidirectional rotation of the arms is achieved by light-induced
switching of an azo unit.

■ INTRODUCTION

In recent years, a large variety of synthetic molecular machines
have been published.1 The design of artiﬁcial molecular
machines often takes
inspiration from the macroscopic
world.2 Here, the aim and challenge are to construct a single
molecule that shows mechanical motion caused by external
stimulation resembling the movement of
its macroscopic
pendant. These attempts have yielded analogues of rotors,3
gears,4 clutches,5 shuttles,6 ratchets,7 elevators,8 muscles,9 etc.10
Furthermore, several entirely synthetic molecular motors have
been designed to convert energy into a controlled rotary
motion.11 As
stimuli, chemical energy,12 light energy,13
electron-transfer processes,14 or a combination of diﬀerent
types of energy15 has been used.

A special challenge is the construction of molecular machines
showing unidirectional, multi-state switching cycles. The
problem in the design of such systems is that the path of
leaving the starting state must diﬀer from the path returning
back to the starting point,16 as otherwise no mechanical work is
performed during one cycle. Therefore, a system is needed that,
on one hand, is ﬂexible enough to allow a complex motion
sequence and, on the other hand,
the
movements are controlled in a single direction.

is so rigid that

the design of

Here, we present

two entirely synthetic
machines that demonstrate unidirectional, four-state switching
cycles that bear similar characteristics to the arm movements of
a human breaststroke swimmer. They are single organic
molecules having a size of about 2 nm and consisting of a
peptidic scaﬀold (torso) and two ﬂexible arms. The arms can be
moved by external stimuli, and the direction of the movement

is controlled by the chiral scaﬀold. The sequence of motion
shows, analogously to the arm movements of a human
breaststroke swimmer,
four states that can be observed by
CD and UV spectroscopy.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Structure, Concept, and Principle of the Molecular
Machine. The targeted unidirectional nanomachine should
pass through a cycle of four states. Such a cycle (I → II → III
→ IV → I), together with the structure, concept, and principle
of the nanomachine,
is depicted in Figure 1. The system
consists of a scaﬀold, which must be chiral to control the
direction of motion, two arms, and two types of hinge (blue
and red circles in Figure 1). Staying with the comparison of this
system with the arm movements of a human breaststroke
swimmer, the scaﬀold corresponds to the human torso and the
arms represent human arms. The blue hinge corresponds to the
shoulder joints, and the red hinges represent the elbow joints.
In state I, both arms are stretched forward. During the
transition from state I to state II, a rotation of the stretched
arms around the blue hinge occurs. This motion can also be
considered to be the power stroke of a breaststroke swimmer. It
is of

move counterclockwise. The second stroke is the folding of the

We intended to build the targeted nanomachine in two steps.
The ﬁrst step was the development of a unidirectional switch
consisting of a chiral scaﬀold and a hinge that performs the
rotation of the arms unidirectionally (blue hinge in Figure 1). If
the direction of motion was successfully proved,
then we
wanted to attach the two arms, with each possessing a further
hinge (red hinges in Figure 1), in a second step.

Synthesis and Functionality of the Unidirectional
Switch. For the synthesis of the unidirectional switch, we
combined a chiral
imidazole-containing macrocycle with an
azobenzene unit. Imidazole-containing macrocycles17 based on
marine peptides18 have already been successfully used for the
synthesis of molecular machines in which the direction of
motion plays an important role.19−21 Azobenzenes are very
popular
light-driven switching units due to their high
reversibility and high photostability, which oﬀer a multitude
of switching cycles.22 Furthermore, they show a high-amplitude
change between the stretched trans form and the more compact
cis isomer, and the direction of movement is controllable.23,24
<para sub="scope">
For our approach, it is important that the orientation of the
arms relative to each other can be controlled in both states.
That means that the arms are ﬁrst stretched forward and that
after the switching process they should be turned by 90° and
point to the side. A system that meets these requirements is a
meta-substituted azobenzene unit attached to a chiral imidazole-
containing clamp.23b The synthesis of this system is depicted in
Figure 2a. The oxidative coupling of aniline 1 leads to 4-fold-

Figure 1. Structure, concept, and principle of the nanomachine. The
nanomachine consists of a torso and two arms. The arms can be
unidirectionally rotated around the blue hinge. The stretching/folding
of the two arms takes place around the two red hinges. Sequence of

the front to the side; power stroke), II → III (folding of the arms), III

arms).

stroke, a rotation of the folded arms around the blue hinge
takes places (III → IV) whereby the direction occurs in exactly
the inverse fashion as that in the ﬁrst step. The fourth stroke is
the stretching of the arms, which leads back to starting state I
and completes the swimming cycle (IV → I).

steps into benzylic bromide 3, which was reacted with chiral
clamp 4b to the desired azo switch, 5. Chiral clamp 4b was
synthesized from commercially available clamp 4a by hydro-
genation.19
</para>
To investigate the motion during the switching process, the
structures of the three possible isomers, trans-5, cis-(P)-5, and
cis-(M)-5, were geometrically optimized by means of B3LYP/6-
31G* (Figure 2b). Subsequently, their CD and UV spectra
were simulated on the basis of
time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) with the B3LYP functional and
by employing the 6-31G* basis set. In Figure 2b, the calculated
structures are depicted. It turned out that the cis-(P) form is
more stable by 83 kJ/mol than the cis-(M) isomer. This huge
energy diﬀerence is responsible for the unidirectionality of the
switching process: Starting from the trans isomer, only the
more stable cis-(P) isomer is formed during the switching
process. Furthermore, the orientation of the bromine atoms in
for using 5 to construct a molecular

machine imitating the mechanical motion sequence of the arms
of a human breaststroke swimmer. In the trans isomer, the
bromine arms point forward, whereas in the cis-(P) isomer, they
are turned by 90° and point to the right and left sides,
respectively. Furthermore, we managed to grow crystals of
trans-5, which were investigated by X-ray analysis. A
comparison shows that the DFT-calculated conformation of
the switching units matches well with the one found in the solid
state (Figures S1 and S2).
<para sub=“props”>
The unidirectionality of the switching process of 5 was
investigated using HPLC, NMR, CD, and UV spectroscopy

(Figures 3 and S3−S5). In the UV spectra, the switching
process can be observed by the decrease of the absorption band
at ca. 330 nm (Figure 3c). This change in the π → π* band is
for isomerization of azobenzene derivatives.22a The
typical
experimentally measured CD spectrum of trans-5 matches quite
well with the simulated one (Figure 3). In the simulated CD
spectrum of cis-(M)-5, a positive Cotton eﬀect of the n → π*
transition at values above 400 nm is found. For the cis-(P)
isomer, a negative Cotton eﬀect of the n → π* transition is
predicted, which is consistent with the measured spectrum.
Furthermore, the obtained cross-peaks in the 1H−1H NOESY
NMR spectrum of cis-5 can be explained only if the formed cis
isomer adopts P conﬁguration (Figure S4). Accordingly, the
light-induced switching process is indeed unidirectional, as
trans-5 is undoubtedly transformed only into cis-(P)-5. The
NMR spectra as well as the HPLC spectra conﬁrm that only
one cis isomer is formed by irradiation with 365 nm light
(Figures S3 and S5). It is also apparent, however, that the
extent of the switching process is lower than usually observed
for azobenzene units. Only 20% of 5 is switched by irradiation
with 365 nm light (Figure S5). The reverse isomerization from
cis-(P)-5 to trans-5 is triggered by irradiation with 405 nm light
(Figure S3). The switching process is repeatable almost any
number of times without a noticeable change in the spectra.

known to be completely and reversibly switchable (Scheme

C−C−N dihedral angle of about 180°, the substituents in
positions 6 and 6′ point in diﬀerent directions and the 2,2′-
biypridine arm is opened. The addition of salts containing
metal ions, for example, Cu2+, leads to a complexation that is
accompanied by rotation around the C−C bipyridine bond
axis.26 In the complex, the N−C−C−N dihedral angle is ca. 0°,
the substituents in position 6 and 6′ point into the same
direction (Scheme 1b), and the 2,2′-biypridine arm is folded.
The reversibility of this movement, the opening of the arms, is

For linking the arms with the chiral scaﬀold, we chose two
approaches: In the ﬁrst nanomachine (9, Scheme 1),
the
bipyridine unit is separated from the azobenzene by a rigid
spacer. Here, the additional rigid spacer should ensure that the
two switching systems are spatially separated from each other
to avoid hindrance during the switching process. In the second
nanomachine (12, Scheme 2), the bipyridine unit is directly
bound to the meta position of the azobenzene.

according to a similar principle (Scheme 2). Here, stannane 11,
which can be synthesized in two steps from 6,6′-dibromo-2,2′-
dipyridyl (6),
is reacted with switch trans-5 using a Stille

After successful nanomachine synthesis, we wanted to ﬁrst

the systems can still be
achieved. Therefore, we analyzed the two systems via HPLC,
NMR, CD, and UV spectroscopy (Figures S6−S11). In all
spectra, the switching process can be proven. In the UV spectra,
a decrease of the π → π* band at ca. 330 nm can be observed.
However, this eﬀect is not very distinct for switch 9 (Figures S6
and S7). The unidirectionality of the process can be seen in the
NMR spectra: Only one of the two diastereomeric cis isomers is
found (Figures S8 and S9). The negative Cotton eﬀects of the
n → π* transition at values above 400 nm can be ascribed to
the cis-(P) isomers (Figures S6 and S7). Accordingly,
irradiation with 365 nm light leads to the transition from
state I (trans-9/trans-12) to state II (cis-(P)-9/cis-(P)-12).
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Furthermore, a comparison of systems 9 and 12 shows that
the extent of light-induced switching is diﬀerent for the two
machines. In the case of switch 9, only ca. 20% is involved in
the switching process (Figures S8 and S10). However,
in

system 12, ca. 30% of the azobenzene units are switched by
light (Figures S9 and S11). We ascribe this to the fact that in
the case of 9 a part of the irradiated light is absorbed by the
rigid spacers so that less light is available for excitation of the
azobenzene unit.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Irradiation with 405 nm light returns state II to initial state I
(trans-9/trans-12). This switching processes are repeatable
almost any number of times without a noticeable change in the
spectra.
</para>
In the second step, we wanted to test if the bipyridine units
of nanomachines 9 and 12 can also be switched. Therefore, the
nanomachines were titrated with diﬀerent metal ions in DCM/
MeCN and analyzed by CD and UV spectroscopy. Addition-
ally,
the metal complexes were investigated by mass
spectrometry. Here, complete conversion was achieved only
with copper ions, and the corresponding metal complexes were
detected by ESI+. In the UV spectra, the formation of copper−
bipyridine complexes can be easily observed by means of an
increase of the absorption band at ca. 370 nm and a decrease of
the band at 320 nm (Figures S12 and S13). For switch 9,
complete conversion is reached at 3.15 equiv; for switch 12,
only 2.15 equiv is necessary.
<para sub=“props”>
Even in the CD spectra, the formation of copper complexes
can be observed. As expected, the bipyridine complex units in
switch 12, which are closer to the chiral clamp, show more
distinct changes in the Cotton eﬀects (Figures S12 and S13).

2+), the mononuclear complexes (9*Cu2+,
(9*Cu2
12*Cu2+) can be unambiguously proven. The addition of the
strong copper ion binder cyclam leads to the original (not
complexed) compounds (Figures S12 and S13). Thus,
titrations with Cu2+ ions and cyclam show that the bipyridine
arms can be folded (trans-9*Cu2
4+; state IV) and reopened
(state I, trans-9), as expected (Figures S12 and S13).
</para>
The combination of both switches using the diﬀerent stimuli
subsequently allows several cycles to be performed for light and
chemically driven switches 9 and 12. The UV and CD spectra
for the ﬁrst cycle are depicted in Figures 4 and 5. The starting
point is the trans isomers (state I), which are transformed in the
ﬁrst stroke into state II (cis-(P) isomers) by irradiation with
365 nm light. This switching process is observable by the
decrease of the absorption bands at 330 nm in the UV spectra
and the more negative Cotton eﬀect at 420 nm. During the
second stroke, the addition of Cu2+ ions causes the folding of
the arms (copper complexes of the cis-(P) isomers), which
corresponds to state III. In the UV spectra, this process can be
observed by means of the bathochromic shifts of the bipyridine
bands to 380 nm. Rotation of the folded arms is triggered by
irradiation with 405 nm light, and state IV (copper complexes
of the trans isomers) is formed in the third stroke. This
reisomerization becomes noticeable by an increase of
the
absorption band at 330 nm in the UV spectra. The so-recorded
spectra are consistent with the ones obtained by titration of the
trans isomers with Cu2+ (Figures S12 and S13). Addition of
cyclam leads to the stretching of the arms, resulting in the trans
isomers, which correspond to state I. The fourth stroke
completes the cycle. The spectra are again identical with those
of the starting compounds; this makes the case for the existence
of a reversible cycle. The cycle can be repeated several times.
The number of cycles is not limited by the system but by the
measurement technique: With increasing overall concentration
of all of the components, the absorption of the entire system is
too high to obtain meaningful CD signals in the desired part of
the spectra.

■ CONCLUSIONS

We have shown that we were able to design molecular
machines that demonstrate unidirectional, four-state switching
cycles that bear similar characteristics to the arm movements of
a human breaststroke swimmer. They are based on a peptidic,
macrocyclic scaﬀold that controls the direction of motion. The
arms performing the swimming movements are rotated around
one hinge and are stretched and folded by another hinge. The
ﬁrst hinge is a meta-substituted azobenzene attached to the
chiral scaﬀold and can be switched by light. The arms are
bipyridine units that are either directly attached or connected
via rigid spacers to the azobenzene unit. The bipyridine units
are stimulated by Cu2+ ions. The movements of these machines
are triggered by alternating addition of chemicals and
irradiation with light. The limiting factor for the repeatability
of the cycles is the dilution eﬀect caused by the addition of
solutions, which worsens the recording of the spectra. The rate-
limiting factor is the time to record the spectra for each cycle.
The current work is a promising small step to an artiﬁcial
nanoswimmer that is propelled in solution by an external
stimuli.

Computational Study. All calculations were performed by using
the program package Gaussian 09.28 The geometrical parameters of
trans-5, cis-(P)-5, and cis-(M)-5 were optimized without symmetry
restriction by means of density functional theory (DFT). For the DFT
method, we used the B3LYP29−31 functional and the 6-31G*32 basis
set. Frequency calculation revealed that the optimized structures have
no imaginary frequency.

The CD and UV spectra of trans-5, cis-(P)-5, and cis-(M)-5 were
simulated with time-dependent density functional
theory (TD-
DFT),33 using the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G* basis set. TD-
DFT calculations were performed at
the optimized ground-state
geometry (B3LYP/6-31G*) of the compounds. The energy, oscillator
strength, and rotatory strength were calculated for each of the 200
lowest singlet excitations.

General Remarks. All chemicals were reagent grade and were used
as purchased. Reactions were monitored by TLC analysis with silica
gel 60 F254 thin-layer plates. Flash chromatography was carried out on
silica gel 60 (230−400 mesh). 1H, 13C, and 2D NMR spectra were
recorded on 300, 500, and 600 MHz spectrometers. All chemical shifts
(δ) are given in ppm. The spectra were referenced to the peak for the
protium impurity in the deuterated solvents indicated in brackets in
the analytical data. HRMS spectra were recorded using a time-of-ﬂight
(TOF) detector. Two high-power light-emitting diodes (LEDs) were
used for the light-induced switching processes. The ﬁrst light source
irradiates 365 nm light, and the second one, 405 nm. Chiral clamp 4a

Synthesis of 11. To a solution of bromide 10 (177 mg, 0.52
mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (8.0 mL) was added a solution of n-
butyllithium in hexane (0.30 mL, 2.5 M, 0.75 mmol) dropwise under
argon at −78 °C. The resulting mixture was stirred for 1 h before
adding ClSnBu3 (0.27 mL, 1.00 mmol) at −78 °C. The solution was
stirred at this temperature for 45 min and subsequently quenched with
a saturated solution of NH4Cl. After phase separation, the aqueous
phase was extracted with dichloromethane. The combined organic
layers were dried over MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo to yield
stannane 11 (280 mg, 0.51 mmol, 98%) as a yellowish oil, which was
used for the next step without further puriﬁcation. 1H NMR (300

Synthesis of trans-12. Pd(PPh3)4 (3.0 mg, 0.002 mmol) was
added to a toluene solution (8 mL) of a mixture of azo compound
trans-5 (25 mg, 0.027 mmol) and stannane 11 (83 mg, 0.150 mmol)
under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred under
argon for 4 days at 95 °C by simultaneous irradiation with UV light (λ
= 365 nm). After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was
evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. Column chromatog-
raphy of the residue on silica gel (dichloromethane/ethyl acetate/
methanol, 75:25:6) provided trans-12 (17.0 mg, 0.013 mmol, 49%) as
an orange solid. mp > 350 °C. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3/CD3OD):
