ABSTRACT: The in situ preparation and trapping of chlorine azide
provided a versatile one-pot method for the azidochlorination of alkenes.
Gaseous ClN3 generated from sodium azide, hypochlorite, and acetic acid
can be explosive if isolation is attempted. Instead, we generated the reagent
in biphasic media in the presence of oleﬁnic compounds dissolved in the
organic layer or evenly emulsiﬁed throughout the solution in the absence of
organic solvent. Under these conditions, ClN3 is created slowly and
trapped immediately at the aqueous−organic interface. The resulting safe
and reliable procedure provided 1,2-azidochloride derivatives of a variety of
substrates, with evidence for both polar and radical mechanisms. Minor
impurities characterized in the product mixtures indicated the presence of
alternative reaction pathways deriving primarily from radical intermediates.

■ INTRODUCTION
Since their initial discovery [in 1900 (IN3),1 1908 (ClN3),2
1925 (BrN3),3 and 1942 (FN3)4,5], halogen azides have been
regarded as challenging compounds to work with due to their
extreme chemical reactivity, volatility, and potential toxicity.
However, the extraordinarily useful nature of halogen and azide
substituents
in organic chemistry has engendered some
exploration of XN3 reactivity through the years. Figure 1
summarizes most of the known examples of the reactions of
halogen azides or their equivalents and analogues with alkenes,
with particular attention to the methods by which these reactive
compounds were generated.

19−30 or I2 + NaN3

Iodine azide was ﬁrst synthesized from AgN3 and I2,1 and
methods associated with its preparation and reactivity6 are the
most abundant in the literature. Hassner and co-workers7−18
made signiﬁcant contributions to the understanding of the
mechanism of halogen azide addition to alkenes, and his
original procedures for the formation of IN3 (from ICl +
31−34) became popular among those
NaN3
disposed to use the reagent for synthetic purposes. Several
alternatives soon followed,
including those with thallium
(TlN3) or stannous (Bu3SnN3) reagents as the source of
azide ion,35−37 but these and other methods38 did not ﬁnd
widespread application. Barluenga et al. found a way to perform
39,40
azido-iodination of
leading to several modiﬁed protocols employing more familiar
iodine,41 periodate,42 oxone,43 and
oxidants (hypervalent
cerium(VI)44,45). In many of these cases, anti-Markovnikov
products were found,
in contrast to earlier reports of the
opposite regiochemistry. Kirsching developed several clever
ways to ameliorate the dangers of IN3, ﬁrst by creating a
nonexplosive polymer-bound form [of general formula R4NI-
(N3)2],46−48 and then by making stable iodine(III)-based

terpenes using IPy2BF4

Consistent with the higher oxidation potential of bromine,
the published chemistry of bromine azide is less extensive than
that of iodine azide. BrN3 was ﬁrst synthesized from Br2 gas and
−HCl−
solid NaN3,3 which was modiﬁed by Hassner [Br2
NaN3]10,13,18 into a somewhat hazardous procedure that
nevertheless achieved some subsequent use.50−52 Other
approaches have involved the in situ generation of toxic and
explosive hydrazoic acid [NXS−HN3, X = I, Br];53,54 the use of
Br2 solution in the presence of sodium azide under neutral or
basic conditions55,56 avoids that particular hazard, albeit with
diminished yields and the formation of other side products. The
accessibility and versatility of the technique reported by Krief in
1974 [NBS−NaN3]57,58 was noted by several groups,59−63 and
other recently published protocols still rely on NBS as the most
common bromine source [NBS−TMSN3].64 A few variations
of this reaction conducted in the presence of catalytic amounts
of various metal triﬂates augmented the regio- and stereo-
selectivity of BrN3 addition to organic substrates,65,66 including
the asymmetric azidobromination of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl
68
compounds.67 Lastly, several sources of Br+ (such as TsNBr2
69) have been used with trimethylsilylazide
and PhNMe3Br3
(TMSN3) in fast and eﬃcient
reactions yielding vicinal
bromoazides under catalyst-free conditions.

While all halogen azides are highly explosive, their stability is
believed to ascend in the following order: FN3 < IN3 < BrN3 <
ClN3.70 A solution of chlorine azide in organic solvents can be
stored for several days at room temperature,2,70 although we do
not recommend this. From its discovery in 1908 through 1965,

(OAc)3
of a chlorine (or other halogen) source with 40% HF yielded
1,2-azido-ﬂuorides−the only transformation of this kind to our
knowledge. Furthermore, Zbiral also reported a competitive
azidochlorinating reagent PhI(Cl)(N3) obtained from phenyl-
iodosodiacetate [MeCOCl−PhI(OAc)2
−TMSN3].79 The reac-
tion outcome based on this reagent system diﬀers considerably
from ClN3-based protocols, including the potential for alkyne
cleavage if there action is performed in the absence of a
chlorine source.80 It is assumed that the reaction occurs via
azidonium ion formation.

Many of the protocols described above lack selectivity, are
low-yielding, or require toxic or exotic reagents. In a search for
a facile and cost-eﬀective technique, we anticipated that N-
chlorosuccinamide (NCS)-based reactions could be a depend-
able option. We were surprised to ﬁnd only several examples
reported thus far,81−83 including a number of recent reports of
azidooxygenation or hydroazidation, rather than chloroazida-
tion, of alkenes.84,85 We therefore turned to the original Raschig
conditions, acidiﬁcation of aqueous sodium azide and sodium
hypochlorite with acetic acid,2 and describe here a convenient
and safe one-pot method and a survey of its application to an
initial panel of various types of alkenes.

Mechanisms of Chlorine Azide Formation and
Degradation. The formation of chlorine azide likely occurs
by azide attack on the hypochlorite bond. It is therefore fastest
at pH 4−6, where signiﬁcant concentrations of N3
− and HOCl
exist (Scheme 1).86 ClN3 is soluble in both aqueous and

organic media,70 giving the solution a characteristic yellow
color. It is quite stable in aqueous solution at room temperature
but can be eliminated from the system either via explosive
decomposition (initiated by heat, for example),87 by reaction
with excess azide or hydroxide in solution, or by productive
addition to unsaturated compounds (Scheme 2). Under acidic
conditions,
immediate
rearrangement to 3N2 can be explosively rapid, and is likely
the source of some of the danger associated with this chemistry.
Basic hydrolysis of ClN3 is relatively slow but can be signiﬁcant;
hydrozidous acid is believed to be the ﬁrst intermediate, leading
either to the formation of nitrogen gas via (N3)2 or hyponitrous

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“ques”>
NaN3 and NaOCl (4.0−4.99% hypochlorite) can be combined
in dilute aqueous solution without apparent reaction for periods
of at least several hours. Chlorine azide formation can be
initiated by the addition of a weak acid such as acetic acid. The
balanced stoichiometry of this overall transformation is shown
in eq 1. The ClN3 thus produced is a gas and can be isolated by
transfer out of the reaction ﬂask with a gentle stream of
nitrogen, bubbled into an organic solvent placed in a receiving
ﬂask. While we performed this procedure a number of times, it
proved to be occasionally explosive, and we strongly discourage
its practice. Instead, we developed a safe procedure to generate
ClN3 in small quantities in situ and in the presence of an alkene
with which it can immediately react, as shown in Figure 2.

Two variants of the procedure were routinely used. In a
biphasic protocol (Figure 2A), an aqueous solution of sodium
azide and sodium hypochlorite was kept either at
room
temperature (20 °C) or was cooled to −15 °C. (A small
amount of brine was added to ensure that the solution at −15
°C would not freeze, but the mixture often remained in the
liquid state without added salt.) The alkene of interest (0.5−1.0
mmol) was dissolved in an organic solvent of lower density
than water (toluene, ether, ethyl acetate), and this solution was

introduced into the reaction ﬂask. The resulting mixture was
then vigorously stirred, chlorine azide generation was initiated
by the dropwise addition of acetic acid to the open or vented
ﬂask (typically 1−2 equiv with respect to azide), and ClN3 was
rapidly consumed in situ by the alkene. The amount and rate of
evolution of ClN3 can be controlled by the amount of acetic
acid added. In most cases, NaN3 was used in excess (2−10
mmol), and the amounts of acetic acid (4−15 mmol) and
sodium hypochlorite (1−2 mmol) were varied. Approximate
concentrations were as follows: NaN3, 0.6−2 mM in the
aqueous phase; NaOCl, 0.4−0.6 mM in the aqueous phase;
AcOH, 0.5−2 mM in the combined phases after addition is
complete; alkene, 0.1−0.5 mM in the organic phase. In an
alternative “solvent-free” biphasic procedure (Figure 2B), no
organic solvent was used. Here,
the liquid alkene was
distributed as an emulsion in the rapidly stirred mixture,
performing the same trapping function during the reaction.
Water-misicible cosolvents (acetonitrile, THF) can be used, but
provided sluggish reactions and poor yields in the few cases
tested. Each organic substrate required the determination of a
partially optimized set of conditions, varying three key
parameters (Figure 2C and Supporting Information):
the
nature of the solvent, the reaction temperature, and the amount
of sodium azide. Caution! Even though these conditions diminish
the hazards of chlorine azide substantially, it is still necessary to use
common sense and care. Furthermore, acidic conditions with azide
ion are always to be used with caution and avoided in workup, since
HN3 is highly volatile, toxic, and explosive. Therefore, the reaction
should be performed only in a well-ventilated fume hood behind a
protective shield or hood sash, and workup should avoid the use of
acid, especially when a large excess of NaN3 is left after the reaction
is complete.

The pioneering studies of Alfred Hassner and co-workers
established that heterolytic cleavage dominates the chemistry of
IN3, such that it reacts predominantly as a source of I+, but
BrN3 and ClN3 can be directed along ionic (heterolytic) or
radical (homolytic) pathways by changing the reaction
conditions.12,17 Polar solvents favor ionic addition for styrenyl
substrates, while nonpolar
solvents and the absence of
molecular oxygen were reported to promote radical forma-
tion.12,17 A continuum of
reactivity is likely, with polar
components to a radical pathway, and,

participation of either chloronium or azidonium cations in
the purposes of
ionic reactions (Scheme 2A). For
this
introductory report, however, we restrict our mechanistic
− or •Cl/•N3 described
discussion to the possibilities of Cl+/N3
by Hassner. Thus,
ionic reactions are expected to produce
regioisomers derived from azide capture of the most stable
cationic intermediate(s); for styrenes, this places azide at the
benzylic position (Scheme 2B). Radical reactions are expected
to proceed by addition of •N3 to give the most stable carbon
radical, which captures ClN3 to continue the chain, giving
benzylic chlorides from styrenes (Scheme 2B, termination steps
not shown). Some byproducts derived from radical pathways
were also expected and observed (Scheme 2C).

Substrate Scope and Limitations. Table 1 summarizes a
preliminary survey of the vicinal azidochlorination of aromatic
alkenes. Most of the substrates (1−6, entries 1−7) underwent
anti-Markovnikov type addition, in agreement with Hassner’s
observation that a radical pathway is favored for
these
substrates. 3,4-Dimethoxystyrene (1) (entry 1) provided an
exception, presumably because the electron-rich nature of the
aromatic ring favored the formation of a cationic benzylic
intermediate. Only at room temperature in toluene was the
radical pathway competitive. The stereochemistry of 1,2-
addition to styrene derivatives was not well controlled,
consistent with the expected stability of the putative benzylic
radical intermediate. Thus, both cis- and trans-stilbene (4 and
4′) gave the same nearly equimolar mixture of erythro and
threo isomers in excellent yield, although this transformation
required a larger excess of sodium azide and higher temperature
to reach completion than for most substrates. (A signiﬁcant
amount of unreacted starting material 4 was isolated at lower
temperatures.) Similarly, 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (5) and 1-
phenyl-1-cyclohexene (6) also gave stereochemical mixtures,
with a modest preference for anti-addition (entries 6 and 7).

isomer 9a isolated as the major product. The azido-carbonyl
derivative 9b was also obtained by a mechanism that we have
not investigated. In contrast, electron-rich nitrogen heterocycles
underwent chlorination rather than chloroazidation under all
conditions tested. Methylindole-6-carboxylate (10) was con-
verted to the corresponding 3,3-dichlorolactam 10a in excellent
yield, implicating hypochlorite as an oxidant as well as a source
of chloride radical. Similarly, 7-azaindole (11) gave only 3-
chloro-1H-pyrollo[2,3-b]pyridine (11a).

known to undergo chlorination with hypochlorite,88−90

Table 2 shows the results of ClN3 reactions with unsaturated

formation of the secondary chloride from 4-allylanisole (12,
entry 1). In this case, radical-derived byproducts were observed
with substantial variation in identity and relative amounts as the
solvent,
stoichiometry, and NaOCl
concentration were changed (see Supporting Information).
Switching to the solvent-free protocol at room temperature
addressed this complication, giving 12a in a consistent and
eﬃcient manner. This procedure (at 20 or −15 °C) proved to
be superior for substrates which remained liquid under the

As before, a two-step mechanism with attack on a radical (or
ionic) intermediate seemed to determine the stereochemistry of
1,2-addition. anti-Chloroazides predominated for cycloheptene
and cholesterol (15 and 17, entries 4 and 7); no stereo-
selectivity was observed for trans-1,4-butenediol (16, entry 5);
and syn-endo products were modestly favored from bridged
bicyclic substrates 13 and 14 (entries 2 and 3). Studies of the
reaction of 13 with variation of solvent and the addition of a
radical trapping agent, described in Supporting Information,
support the assignment of a primarily radical pathway using this
substrate. The isopropenyl group of (S)-(+)-carvone (18)
participated in dual
reactivity depending on the reaction
conditions (entries 8, 9). At low temperatures in EtOAc as the
organic solvent, only allylic chlorination (18a) was observed,
whereas reaction in the less polar toluene at room temperature
gave rise to the azidochloride 18b in modest yield (23%), which
could be increased to 42% with the use of a higher
concentration of NaN3 in the aqueous phase. In both cases, a
signiﬁcant amount of starting material 18 remained in the
mixture; all other attempts to drive the reaction to completion
resulted in the formation of more 18a as a byproduct.

The existence of

radical chlorination as an alternative
reaction was further demonstrated by the fate of three other
substrates. Anthracene (19, entry 10) gave both 9-azido (19a)

is shown in Scheme 3. The expected addition of azide radical to
C-9 followed by trapping with ClN3 provides intermediate 19c,
with the observed products deriving from either base-mediated
chloride elimination or oxidative aromatization. (Interestingly,
phenanthrene was completely resistant to the biphasic reaction

■ CONCLUSIONS

We describe here a simple, reliable,
inexpensive, and safe
method for the generation of ClN3 and its use for the
preparation of 1,2-azidochlorides from oleﬁns. Its success relies
on the slow generation and rapid capture of ClN3, both of
which are enabled by the use of biphasic reaction conditions,
preventing the buildup of the explosive oxidant. Aryl, alcohol,
alkyne, ester, and ether functional groups are well tolerated;
others will be tested in due course. The method is not presently
applicable to molecules containing electron-rich aromatic rings
or free amines, which undergo radical chlorination faster than
chloroazidation. 1,2-Azidochlorides are expected to be a very
useful class of organic compounds

derivatization by a variety of processes, including 1,3-dipolar
cycloaddition, SN2 or anchimerically assisted substitution,

tion of polymeric materials and surfaces.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
Representative and detailed procedures for azidochlorination of oleﬁns
are described below; the largest scale employed for these procedures
was 2 mmol of alkene.

(A). General Biphasic Procedure. Sodium azide (150 mg, 2.31
mmol) was added to a mixture of aqueous sodium hypochlorite
(4.00−4.99% obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, 3.5 mL, 2.06 mmol) and 2
mL of an organic solvent (PhMe, EtOAc, or Et2O, unless otherwise
stated). The mixture was stirred brieﬂy to dissolve the NaN3. An
organic substrate (13) (88 mg, 0.61 mmol) was added to the resulting
heterogeneous mixture, allowed to dissolve in the organic media, and
the resulting biphasic mixture was either kept at room temperature (20
°C) or cooled to −15 °C. With continuous vigorous magnetic stirring,
a solution of glacial acetic acid (0.25 mL, 4.37 mmol) in 2 mL of the
organic solvent was added in dropwise fashion with a syringe over a
period of 15 min to 1 h. After the addition was complete, the mixture
was stirred at 20 °C for an additional 30 min to 2 h (or, if initially
carried out at −15 °C, the reaction was allowed to warm to room
temperature over a period of 30 min to 2 h).
(B). General Solvent-Free Procedure. Sodium azide (350 mg,
5.38 mmol) was dissolved in aqueous sodium hypochlorite (4.00−
4.99% obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, 4 mL, 2.36 mmol) immediately
prior to use, and the resulting solution was cooled to −15 °C if
desired. An organic substrate (5) (as a neat liquid, 0.1 mL, 0.63 mmol)
was added to the resulting aqueous solution, which was either kept at
room temperature (20 °C) or cooled to −15 °C. A solution of glacial
acetic acid (0.26 mL, 4.54 mmol) in 2 mL of water was added
dropwise with a syringe over the period of 15 min to 1 h to the
vigorously stirred mixture. After the addition was complete,
the
resulting reaction mixture was stirred at 20 °C for an additional 30 min
to 2 h (or allowed to warm to room temperature over a period of 30
min to 2 h if it had been initially cooled).

(C). Workup. For each of the above procedures, the completed
reaction (monitored by TLC) was quenched by the slow addition of
saturated aq. NaHCO3 (5 mL) at 20 °C, during which the evolution of
CO2 ceased, followed by stirring for 5−10 min. The biphasic mixture
was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 5 mL), the combined organic layers
were dried over anhydrous MgSO4,
the resulting solution was
concentrated by rotary evaporation, and the crude product was
puriﬁed by ﬂash chromatography or preparative thin-layer chromatog-
raphy (silica gel, hexanes/EtOAc).

(D). Important Notes. (1) The solvent-free conditions should be
used only if the alkene remains in the liquid state throughout the
process (in other words, does not freeze if the reaction is cooled; true
here for compounds 1−3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21). (2) Brine can
be added if the reaction is performed at −15 °C to prevent the
aqueous medium (solution of NaOCl, NaN3, and AcOH) from
solidifying. (3) Caution! Even though these conditions diminish the
hazards of chlorine azide substantially, it is still necessary to use common
sense and care. The addition of glacial acetic acid is an exothermic reaction
accompanied by rapid gas evolution (ClN3, and possibly N2, Cl2, HN3). It
is important to add the acetic acid solution slowly (dropwise), and to make
sure the flask is open or vented to relieve pressure. Furthermore, acidic
conditions with azide ion are always to be used with caution and avoided
in workup, since HN3 is highly volatile, toxic, and explosive. Therefore, the
reaction should be performed only in a well-ventilated fume hood behind a
protective shield or hood sash, and workup should avoid the use of acid,
especially when a large excess of NaN3 is left after the reaction is complete.
(4) The procedures described here were optimized using only the
4.00−4.99% solution of sodium hypochlorite available from Sigma-
Aldrich. Higher concentrations of sodium hypochlorite were not
exhaustively tested, but preliminary experiments showed a greater
propensity for runaway reactions at higher active concentrations of
NaOCl. (5) Remaining unreacted chlorine azide and any HN3 ion
were neutralized and quenched by the added saturated sodium

bicarbonate solution,86 and (like diazomethane) by letting the mixture
stir open to air in the fume hood to allow ClN3 to evaporate.
(E). Structure Elucidation. Since the chemical shifts of protons
attached to C−N3 and C−Cl centers are very similar,
the
determination of the 1,2-azidochloride regio- and stereochemistry
requires some care. We employed the convenient and reliable thermal
[3 + 2] cycloaddition of organic azides with an excess of
dimethylacetylene dicarboxylate (DMAD)99 to make the correspond-
ing 1,2,3-triazoles of many of the compounds reported above (Tables
S8 and S9), and characterized these products extensively by 1D and
2D NMR techniques and X-ray crystallographic analysis (Figures S2
and S3). Further details can be found in Supporting Information.

C60 Derivatives. The fullerene C60 was subjected to general
procedure I in either chlorobenzene or toluene solvent, resulting in
the complete consumption of starting material and the isolation of a
product (or mixture of products) with good mass recovery (Scheme
4). The presence of the azide group in the product was conﬁrmed by
IR spectroscopy (strong asymmetric stretch at 2094 cm−1, weaker
symmetric stretching band at 1217 cm−1),98 and by reduction with
polymer-bound triphenylphosphine to give the amine derivative 22a′.
The presence of chloride has not been veriﬁed, so structures 22a and
22a′ are speculative at present.
