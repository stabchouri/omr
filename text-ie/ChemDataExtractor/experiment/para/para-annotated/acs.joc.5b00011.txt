ABSTRACT: The combination of a catalytic amount of InCl3
and acetic anhydride remarkably promotes the Knoevenagel
condensation of a variety of aldehydes and activated methylene
compounds. This catalytic system accommodates aromatic
aldehydes containing a variety of electron-donating and -with-
drawing groups, heteroaromatic aldehydes, conjugate alde-
hydes, and aliphatic aldehydes. Central to successfully driving
the condensation series is the formation of a geminal diacetate intermediate, which was generated in situ from an aldehyde and an
acid anhydride with the assistance of an indium catalyst.

■ INTRODUCTION

The Knoevenagel reaction is a condensation between activated
methylene and carbonyl compounds in the presence of a weak
base, such as an amine; it is a powerful and practical tool for the
formation of a carbon−carbon double bond.1 Because the
multisubstituted alkenes that are produced can further be used
for a variety of molecular transformations, such as Michael
additions and Diels−Alder reactions, a number of organic
chemists have continuously improved this useful conversion.1d
In a typical Knoevenagel condensation, a catalytic amount of
primary or secondary amines along with their ammonium salts
acts as an eﬀective promoter, in which the formation of the
iminium intermediate derived from the amine and a carbonyl
compound plays a central role in promoting condensation.2
During the past two decades, several Lewis acid catalysts have
been used to promote Knoevenagel condensations.3 In general,
however, aldehydes with coordinating functional groups, such
as methoxy, nitro, or cyano groups, and heterocyclic aldehydes
are unsuitable for use as a substrate in a Lewis-acid-catalyzed
Knoevenagel condensation with activated methylene that has
a relatively low degree of acidity, such as dimethyl malonate
(pKa = 15.9 in DMSO).4 This is probably due to deactivation of
the acidic catalyst by coordination rather than by activation of
the carbonyl compound that is used.

Indium compounds are known to display a high tolerance for
functional groups.5 We have joined several other researchers in
reporting on indium-catalyzed conversions of various carbonyl
compounds with a variety of functional groups.6 On the basis of
these reports, we anticipated that the indium compound that
shows unique activation of typical carbonyl compounds will
eﬀectively promote a Knoevenagel condensation with a weak
carbonyl compound that includes a coordinating functional
group.7 Herein, we report a novel catalytic system composed of
indium chloride and acetic anhydride that eﬀectively promotes the
Knoevenagel condensation of aromatic/aliphatic/heteroaro-

matic aldehydes with a variety of activated methylene com-
pounds, leading to the preparation of substituted alkene deriv-
atives. We also describe how the condensation series proceeds
via the indium-promoted formation of a geminal diacetate
intermediate that is derived from an aldehyde with acetic acid
anhydride.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
On the basis of conventional Knoevenagel reactions, we initially
investigated reaction conditions using benzaldehyde (1a) and
dimethyl malonate (2a) as a model substrate (Table 1). When
a reaction was performed with 10 mol % of InBr3 in toluene
at 60 °C for 8 h, only 3% of Knoevenagel product 3aa was
detected (entry 1). Thus, to promote the initial abstraction of
the activated proton, the addition of 1 equiv of several bases
to the reaction mixture was examined. Consequently, when
the primary amine 2-aminoethanol was added, the yield was
remarkably increased to 61% (entry 2). The addition of a
secondary or tertiary amine, however, was ineﬀective for the
present condensation (entries 3 and 4). Upon further screening
several additives for the condensation reaction,8 1 equiv of
acetic anhydride showed the best additive eﬀect to aﬀord cor-
responding product 3aa in 89% yield (entry 5). Then, a
counteranion eﬀect of the indium catalyst was investigated
in the presence of Ac2O. InCl3 produced the best yield of
Knoevenagel product 3aa in 94% NMR yield (86% isolated
yield) along with the formation of a small amount (4%) of
geminal diacetate 4a. Stronger Lewis acids, InI3 and In(OTf)3,
showed a similar catalytic eﬀect and provided alkene 3aa
in 79% (with 8% of diacetate 4a) and 82% yields, respec-
tively (entries 7 and 8); however, In(OH)3 and In(OAc)3
produced neither the corresponding alkene 3aa nor diacetate

undergo the expected condensation to yield a Knoevenagel
product (entry 11). When the reaction was conducted with
other solvents, such as CHCl3, CH3CN, CH3OH, and THF,
remarkable improvement in the yield of 3aa was not observed.9

The general application of aromatic aldehydes 1 for a
Knoevenagel condensation with dimethyl malonate (2a) was
next investigated in toluene at 60 °C for 8 h (Table 2).
Aldehydes containing a strong electron-donating group, such as
either Me2N or MeO groups, on the benzene ring aﬀorded the
corresponding products 3ba−3ea in good yields (entries 1−4).
During the condensation series, neither the amino nor the
methoxy groups, which generally deactivate a typical Lewis acid
via coordination, had an eﬀect on the activation by InCl3.
Similarly, 4-methyl- and 4-phenyl-substituted aromatic alde-
hydes also undertook the condensation to produce alkenes
3fa and 3ga in 80 and 84% yields, respectively, within 5−7 h
(entries 5 and 6). The catalytic condensation of halogen-
substituted benzaldehydes 1h−1l with malonate 2a proceeded
successfully to isolate adducts 3ha−3la in excellent yields
(entries 7−11). Benzaldehyde derivatives bearing an electron-
withdrawing group, such as a methoxycarbonyl, triﬂuoromethyl,
cyano, or nitro group, generally showed slightly higher
reactivity than benzaldehydes with an electron-donating
group to give the Knoevenagel products 3ma−3ra in 80−
98% yields (entries 12−17). When salicylaldehyde (1s) was
used as a substrate, the expected Knoevenagel alkene product
was not detected. Instead, further O-acetylated product 5 and
an intramolecular cyclization product, coumarin derivative 6,
were obtained in 40 and 7% yields, respectively (entry 18). For
the substrates shown in Table 2, a small amount of the cor-
responding diacetate 4 was detected by 1H NMR analysis.

To expand on the scope of an activated methylene derivative,
we conducted an InCl3-catalyzed Knoevenagel condensation of
benzaldehyde (1a) with several methylene compounds 2 in the
presence of Ac2O (Table 3). For example, the reaction of
benzaldehyde with β-ketoester methyl acetoacetate (2b) and
ethyl benzoylacetate (2c) eﬃciently gave the Knoevenagel


the methylene with geminal diacetate.

β-Ketoamide 2d aﬀorded desired product 3ad in a rather low
yield11 at an extended reaction time of 30 h, possibly because a
decrease in the nucleophilicity of the methylene moiety by an
the amino group hindered the
electron-donating eﬀect of
reaction of
It was
remarkable, however, that when the condensation was carried
out with malonic acid (2e), 2-benzylidene-malonic acid (3ae)
was obtained in 79% yield without a Doebner-type decarbox-
ylation.12 Also, when the reaction of malononitrile (2f) was
carried out in toluene, only 15% (NMR yield) of the product
was obtained. It was interesting that the use of N,N-dimethyl-
formamide (DMF) as a solvent instead of toluene successfully
improved the chemical yield of alkene 3af to 86%. When the
condensation of 1a with the cyclic 1,3-diketone dimedone (2g)
was conducted under the optimal conditions, 1:2 adduct 7
(a xanthenedione derivative) was isolated as the sole product,
which otherwise would have been produced via a further
Michael addition of 2g to the ﬁrst Knoevenagel adduct and a
subsequent intramolecular cyclodehydration.7g

<para sub="scope">
Further application of the indium-catalyzed condensation to
a variety of aldehydes 8, except for benzaldehyde with dimethyl
malonate (2a), was then investigated in the presence of Ac2O
(Table 4). When 4-formylpyridine (8a) was used as a substrate,
the corresponding alkene product 9aa was obtained in 65%
yield (entry 1). In this case, InCl3 was unnecessary for the con-
densation based on the fact that alkene 9aa (68% NMR yield)
was obtained in the absence of InCl3. When the reactions of
either a pyridyl aldehyde, which have a more sterically hindered
portion around the nitrogen atom, 2-bromo-6-formylpyridine
(8b), or 2-thiophenyl aldehyde (8c) with malonate ester 2a
were treated with our optimal conditions,
the extended
π-conjugate heteroaromatic compounds 9ba and 9ca were
obtained in good yields (entries 2 and 3). Also, the present
Knoevenagel condensation could be applied to either a
conjugated or an aliphatic aldehyde in addition to an aromatic
aldehyde. For example, a conjugated aldehyde, (E)-cinnamal-
dehyde (8d), reacted with the malonate ester to aﬀord α, β, γ,
δ-unsaturated carbonyl compound 9da in 79% yield, which
retained the double-bond geometry (entry 4). The reactions of
linear aliphatic aldehydes 8e and 8f were completed within 24 h
to give the corresponding products 9ea and 9fa in good yields
(entries 5 and 6). Moreover, when α-branched aldehydes
8g−8j were reacted with malonate 2a, the expected alkenes
9ga−9ja,
respectively, were produced in 68−72% yields
(entries 7−10).

<para sub="scope">
As control experiments, the reaction of benzaldehyde (1a)
with 1 equiv of Ac2O was conducted both with and without
InCl3 (eq 1 in Scheme 1). In the former reaction, the cor-
responding geminal diacetate 4a was quickly obtained in 91%
yield at room temperature, but
in the latter reaction, no
formation of diacetate 4a nor any other byproducts were ob-
served. Moreover, to ﬁnd out whether geminal diacetate 4a
would be an intermediate in the Knoevenagel reaction series,13
the reaction of 4a with dimethyl malonate 2a was next ex-
amined both with and without
InCl3. Consequently,
Knoevenagel adduct 3aa was obtained in 79% yield in the
presence of a catalytic amount of InCl3, but the reaction with-
out the indium catalyst did not produce the corresponding
product along with the recovery of starting diacetate 4a (eq 2 in
Scheme 1). These results indicate that geminal diacetate 4a is
one of the intermediates in the Knoevenagel condensation and
proves that the indium catalyst is necessary for both stages

On the basis of the results obtained by the control experi-
ments, a plausible reaction mechanism for the present con-
densation is shown in Scheme 2. When aldehyde 1 is activated
by an indium catalyst,
it initially reacts with Ac2O to form
geminal diacetate 4,14 the formation of which facilitates a sub-
sequent nucleophilic attack of an enolizable activated
methylene compound in the presence of the indium catalyst15
to produce intermediate A. Finally, intramolecular elimination
of acetic acid occurs to aﬀord substituted alkene 3 along with
regeneration of the indium catalyst.

■ CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have demonstrated an indium-catalyzed
Knoevenagel condensation between aldehydes with activated
methylene compounds in the presence of acetic acid anhydride,
leading to the preparation of polysubstituted alkenes. Also, we
have clariﬁed that to drive the Knoevenagel condensation series
forward, in situ formation of a geminal diacetate intermediate
derived from an aldehyde and acetic anhydride is essential. To
date, several examples involving the conversion of aldehydes to
geminal diacetates or the synthesis of Knoevenagel products
from geminal diacetates have been reported. This novel pro-
cedure presents one-pot access to Knoevenagel products from
various aldehydes via geminal diacetate as a key intermediate.
Also, in conventional Lewis acid-catalyzed Knoevenagel con-
densations, substrates were limited to mainly either aldehydes
bearing a noncoordinating functional group or activated
methylenes with relatively high acidic hydrogen. With the
present catalytic system in hand, therefore, the carbonyl com-
pounds used in the Knoevenagel condensation could be
extensively expanded to heteroaromatic, conjugate, and
aliphatic aldehydes,
including a variety of benzaldehydes.
Moreover, we disclosed that the present method could be
applied to various activated methylenes other than a malonate
ester. The use of an indium compound with a unique and high
tolerance to various functional groups allowed for extension of
the substrate and a new entry for the preparation of valuable
substituted alkenes. Further attempts to elucidate the reaction
mechanism and extend the substrate scope are now in progress.

contained a PTFE septum, the mixture was heated at 60 °C. The

(8) When the reaction of 1a with 2a in the presence of a catalytic
amount of InBr3 in toluene was conducted at 60 °C for 8 h using
various additives, such as TMSCl, Tf2O, and (CF3CO)2O,
the
corresponding Knoevenagel adduct 3aa was obtained in 30, 0, and
27% yield, respectively.
(9) The yields of 3aa and 4a under the conditions in entry 6 of Table
1 are listed as follows: 95 and 0% in CH3Cl, 68 and 6% in CH3CN3, 4
and 32% in THF, respectively, and 0% each in MeOH. Although
CH3Cl was a slightly better solvent than toluene (94 and 4%), we
chose toluene as the best solvent due to its good mass balance.
(10) The E:Z geometries of the products 3ab and 3ac were assigned
on the basis of NOESY analyses.
(11) A sole geometric isomer of 3ad was obtained; unfortunately, the
geometry (E or Z) was not able to be determined.
