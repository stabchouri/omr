ABSTRACT: Recently, we have demonstrated that the photogeneration of Vilsmeier−Haack reagents is possible using only
dimethylformamide (DMF) and tetrabromomethane (CBr4) in the bromination of alcohols. Extending these ﬁndings to
carboxylic acid substrates has produced a mild and facile approach to the in situ formation of symmetric anhydrides, which were
conveniently converted to amide derivatives in a one-pot process. The eﬃcient protocols discussed herein are marked by use of
UVA LEDs (365 nm), which have reduced the reaction times and come with a low setup cost.

T he activation of carboxylic acids has been paramount to

the synthesis of peptides in coupling reactions with
amines.1 A variety of methods make carboxylic acids more
electrophilic either by transforming the carboxylic acid into the
corresponding acyl halide or through the addition of coupling
agents.2 Symmetric anhydrides have also seen great use in
peptide chemistry because they provide electrophilic activation
of the carboxylic moiety without forming coupling byproducts,
as both electrophilic sites are identical. However,
these
anhydrides are often formed through the same procedures
that apply to amide couplings3 (acyl halide formation and then
addition of carboxylates). New protocols oﬀering the formation
of anhydrides directly from the corresponding carboxylic acids
along with the direct formation of amides in a one-pot process
are of interest for development.4

Photoredox catalysis has emerged as a powerful tool in the
development of new organic transformations, especially in
forming C−C, C−N, and C−O bonds.5 Vilsmeier−Haack
reagents for useful organic transformations can be generated
with photoredox catalysis;6,7 however, studies among our group
found that generation of the Vilsmeier−Haack reagent without
use of a photocatalyst is possible from the irradiation of CBr4
with UVA light (365 nm LED) in DMF under an air
atmosphere.8 Notably, visible light, in comparison, was unable
to achieve this transformation. This was used as a synthetically
facile route to bromoalkanes
from alcohols, which was
applicable to a one-pot deoxygenation protocol.8b,9 Taking
this into consideration, we sought to apply the photogeneration
of Vilsmeier−Haack reagents from UVA and CBr4 in a one-pot

protocol

anisic acid with 1 equiv of CBr4 and 2 equiv of 2,4,6-

by the precipitation of collidine hydrobromide. Removal of
collidine resulted in little product formation (entry 4). Control
experiments were performed that demonstrated that no
reaction occurred upon heating at 80 °C without
light
irradiation in the presence of CBr4 (entry 5) or UVA
irradiation in the absence of CBr4 (entry 7). Notably, the
transformation does not react under visible light irradiation
(410 nm LED, entry 6).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Having these conditions in hand, we established the scope of
the transformation using a wide array of carboxylic acids (Table
2). Nonaromatic carboxylic acids
including long chains,
primary, secondary, and tertiary α-centers were converted in
nearly quantitative yields, forming stable anhydrides 2b−d and
2h (entries 1−3 and 7). The reaction proved to be tolerant to
alkenes and alkynes; the corresponding anhydrides 2d−f were
obtained in 75 to 98% yields (entries 4−6)
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Interestingly, N-Boc and N-CBz protected L-alanine showed
only degradation (entry 8); however, Cbz protected L-proline
was fully converted to the corresponding anhydride 2j (entry
9).10 This may be attributed to instability of the anhydride
formed. Various aromatic carboxylic acids were screened; a
wide variety of
functionality is tolerated in good yields,
including OMe, t-Bu, halides, CF3, naphthyl, and, to some
extent, ortho and meta substitution (entries 10−20 and 24). 2-
Carboxylic acid substituted heterocycles thiophene 2v, furan
2w, and N-methylpyrrole 2x were also compatible with this
method (entries 21−23). Phthalic acid also converted
quantitatively to phthalic anhydride 2z (entry 25),
in an
intramolecular version of this transformation.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
The method showed a robust general applicability; however,
isolation of many aromatic anhydrides resulted in some
degradation or loss of product. Often, these compounds are
used in amide couplings as the coupling partner for an amine. It
was reasoned that a one-pot procedure for the coupling of these
anhydrides
to an amine should be developed to avoid
degradation of
the anhydride through work up steps. An
optimization of the bases added to the reaction (Table 3)
showed that 3 equiv of carboxylic acid, 5 equiv of collidine, and
1 equiv of DMAP furnished the best yield of amide formation
(3) in the coupling of carboxylic acid 1c and piperidine using
CBr4 with UVA LED light in DMF (entry 9). The analogous
method using [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 (5 mol %) with visible light
(CFL light) gave little formation of either anhydride or amide
product, 9% (entry 11). More importantly, the same reaction
without [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 gave a similar yield, 7% (entry 12).
This may be due to the intensity of these lights being relatively
weak compared to high-powered LED systems. A high-powered
410 nm LED was used, giving 12% yield with [Ru(bpy)3]-
(PF6)2, but it also yielded 8% without the photocatalyst (entries
13 and 14). One aspect of using more powerful lighting sources
is that background activation (reaction with light source in the
absence of photocatalyst, as shown in this study) may occur,
which circumvents the need for photoredox catalysts. Also, the
excited state of [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 may be quenched by the
amine in solution, which does not result in product forming
pathways. For these reasons, a photomediated method for the
combination of carboxylic acids with amines without a
photocatalyst gives the best conditions for amide synthesis.

An extension of the amide protocol also showed promising
results, (Table 4). Carboxylic acids
functionalized with
cyclohexane, phenyl, and 4-CF3-phenyl were chosen to
represent alkyl, aryl, and electron-withdrawing functionalities.

the photogeneration of Vilsmeier−Haack
reagents from irradiation of CBr4 with UVA light in DMF
has been shown to be a useful method for the generation of
symmetric anhydrides. This process is conveniently applicable
to a one-pot synthesis of amides from readily available
carboxylic acids and amines, without need of a photoredox
catalyst. These studies not only exhibit the importance of
photochemical transformations in the synthesis of amide bonds
but also the power of conducting control reactions and light-
source optimization in developing fast, eﬃcient, and reagent-
minimizing methods in organic synthesis.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General

Information. All

reactions were performed under
atmospheric air (unless otherwise noted) in Pyrex glassware equipped
with a magnetic stir bar, capped with a septum. DMF was ﬁltered using
a puriﬁcation system. Commercial reagents were used without further
puriﬁcation. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) analysis. TLC plates were viewed under UV light and stained
with potassium permanganate or p-anisaldehyde staining solution. 1H
NMR spectra were recorded on 300 or 400 MHz in chloroform-d, and
chemical
shifts are reported in ppm referenced to residual
undeuterated solvent. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift,
multiplicity, coupling, integration. 13C NMR spectra were recorded on
75 or 101 MHz. Optical rotations were recorded at 589 nm with 0.1
dm/2 mL sample cell. Retention of conﬁguration was determined by
running an analogous reaction with racemic mixtures of either amine
or acid with respect to the amide couplings, with workup in the usual
way. Samples were diluted with 5% i-PrOH in hexane and run on a
chiral HPLC; chromatographs are available in the Supporting
Information (column: AD-H, 5% i-PrOH/hexanes, 1.0 mL/min,
over 60 min).

General Procedure 1 (GP1). Preparation of Symmetric
Anhydrides from Carboxylic Acids. To an 8 mL Pyrex screw-top
reaction vessel were added substrate (0.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and
dimethylformamide (1.5 mL, 0.2 M) and then 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine
(0.6 mmol, 2.0 equiv) and carbontetrabromide (0.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv).
The reaction mixture was capped and irradiated with a UVA (365 nm)
LED at a distance of 1 cm for 30 min. The resulting mixture was
poured into a separatory funnel containing 25 mL of a 3:1 mixture of
diethyl ether and hexanes (ethyl acetate was added for compounds that
needed further solubility). This was washed with water, where the
combined aqueous fractions were re-extracted with 25 mL of diethyl
ether. The combined organic portions were washed with saturated
sodium bicarbonate and brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The
solution was concentrated in vacuo, and products were weighed for

mixture was capped and irradiated with a UVA (365 nm) LED at a
distance of 1 cm for 30 min. The resulting mixture was poured into a
separatory funnel containing 25 mL of ethyl acetate. This was washed
with 1 M HCl, where the combined aqueous fractions were re-
extracted with 25 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined organic portions
were washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate and brine and dried
over sodium sulfate. Products were further puriﬁed by column
