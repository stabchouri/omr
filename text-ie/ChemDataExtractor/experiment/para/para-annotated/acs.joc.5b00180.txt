ABSTRACT: The title reaction is investigated in detail
theoretically using density functional theory. After 5-endo-dig
cyclization by nucleophilic attack, ﬁve possible pathways are
taken into account in this work: direct ring expansion followed
or accompanied by proton-transfer (paths A and B,
respectively), 1,3-cationic migration (path C), proton-transfer
before ring expansion (path D), and processing via a gold-
nitrene (path E). Results indicate that the reaction would
undergo the favored sequential pathway (path A) rather than
other pathways. Moreover, the concerted mechanism (path B),
which is designed to account for the selectivity of product in the experiment, would be unlikely in the reaction. The selectivity of
product could be explained by the hindrance of ligand (t-BuXPhos) and the stability of the carbocation. Moreover, the binding
energy of product complexes could account for the observed reaction rate.

1. INTRODUCTION
The smallest nitrogen-containing unsaturated heterocycles with
a CN double bond in a three-membered ring, 2H-azirines,
have been extensively studied in natural products and synthetic
applications.1,2 It is easy to form 2H-azirines using the Neber
reaction or other strategies.3 Because of the intrinsic strain of the
three-membered ring, these compounds can undergo facile ring-
opening. As a source of nitrenes, electrophiles, dienophiles, and
dipolarophiles, 2H-azirines can be used for N-heterocycle
syntheses, such as for indoles, pyrroles, isoxazoles, and pyridines.
In the past decade, transformation of 2H-azirines to other
chemicals has attracted much attention, and many elegant
methods have been developed.4
For the transformation of 2H-azirines, there are still limited
methods to break the C−N single bond.1,4,5 For example, 2H-
azirines can be considered as synthetic equivalents of alkenyl
nitrenes under organometallic catalysis. This type of trans-
formation is available by using Rh(I), Fe(II), and Cu(II)
catalysts.5 Both experimental predictions and computational
results indicate that a metal-nitrene reactive intermediate can
occur in these reactions.5 On the basis of experimental results
reported by Narasaka and Zheng, Yan and co-workers system-
atically studied the ring-expansion mechanism of 2-aryl-2H-
azirines to 2,3-disubstitued indoles using the density functional
method (DFT).5b They found that, in FeCl2-catalyzed reactions,
it is easy to undergo ring-opening to form an iron-nitrene
intermediate on the quintet potential energy surface, and the
rate-determining step is associated with ring-closure (C−N bond
formation), whereas the rate-determining step changes to the
ring-opening of azirine to aﬀord a ruthenium-nitrene inter-
mediate in the Ru2(O2CCF3)4-catalyzed reaction on the singlet
potential energy surface (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1. Rearrangement Mechanism of 2-Aryl-2H-azirines
to 2,3-Disubstitued Indoles via a Metal-Nitrene Intermediate

Over the past decade, homogeneous gold(I)-catalyzed organic
transformation has attracted much attention in experimental6
and theoretical7 studies due to the unique ability of gold to
coordinate with unsaturated bonds. Recently, Gagosz and co-
workers reported a novel gold(I)-catalyzed synthesis of function-
alized pyridines from alkynyl-containing 2H-azirines (Scheme
2).8 According to their experimental observations, sequential
(path A) and concerted (path B) mechanistic pathways were
attempted for the reaction. First, the nucleophilic addition of
nitrogen to gold(I)-activated alkyne leads to ﬁve-membered ring
intermediate 2. Then, followed or accompanied by 1,2-migration
of neighboring group, three-membered ring expansion can ﬁnish
the reaction. Although they proposed the concerted mechanism
to account for the selectivity of product when a substitution is
placed at the propargylic position (C3), they suggested that both
mechanisms could operate because it is diﬃcult to rule out either
individual mechanism from the experimental results.

Scheme 2. Possible Reaction Pathways for the rRearrangement of 2-Propargyl 2H-Azirine

facilitate the development of practical methodologies for
synthetic chemistry. Similar to the title reaction, gold(I)-
catalyzed cycloisomerization of 1,5-enynes containing a cyclo-
propene moiety was experimentally studied by Wang et al. and
computationally veriﬁed by Li et al.9 Both results support the
occurrence of competitive 1,3-cationic alkylidene migration in
the rearrangement after 1,5-endo-dig cyclization, rendering two
possible products depending on the substituent groups. In this
sense, except for the proposed “sequential” and “concerted”
mechanisms noted above, the process (path C in Scheme 2) via
1,3-cationic alkylidene migration should be checked in the title
reaction. In this pathway, we found that intermediate 6, in which
two three-membered rings share one edge, could occur in the
reaction (see the Results for details). We considered one more
possible pathway in which 1,2-migration occurs prior to ring
expansion (path D). Additionally, we also checked a possible
pathway through a gold(I)-nitrene intermediate (12, path E).
Accordingly, Scheme 2 depicts the ﬁve possible pathways
promoted by one gold(I) catalyst.

Our motivation in this work is to clarify the detailed reaction
process using pure computations and to examine which pathway
would be more favorable to occur in the reaction. The spatial
eﬀect of a real ligand in the catalyst is also evaluated for the
reaction. Additionally, it is interesting to understand the reactive
intermediates, including the competition between the 2H-azirine
moiety and alkyne for binding to the gold(I) catalyst and whether
it is possible to form a gold-nitrene intermediate via opening of
the three-membered ring.

and the self-consistent reaction ﬁeld (SCRF) theory. Recent assessment
shows that PBE0 can suitably describe gold complexes.11 The standard
6-311+G(d,p) basis set on nonmetal atoms and the Def2-TZVP basis
set, including eﬀective core potential (ECP) on Au atoms, were used for
the model system (denoted as BS-I), whereas 6-31G(d,p) and Def2-SVP
basis sets (denoted as BS-II) were used for the real system to reduce
computational cost.12 After geometry optimization, harmonic vibra-
tional analyses were performed at the same level to conﬁrm that each
minimum has no imaginary frequency and that each transition state
(TS) has only one imaginary frequency. The minimum energy path
(MEP) was also traced using the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC)13
method to ensure that each TS structure correctly links with two
minima. The implicit IEF-PCM solvent model was adopted to evaluate
solvent eﬀect on the reaction in CH2Cl2 (ε = 10.125).14 To match with
the experimental conditions, all energies were corrected at 85 °C and 1
atm. Generally, compared to geometry, energy is sensitive to the
computational method. Recently, a double-hybrid functional method
(such as B2PLYP) including second-order perturbation energy was
recommended for the energy computations.15 In this sense, single-point
energy calculations were carried out at the B2PLYP/BS-I level for the
model system and the ONIOM(B2PLYP/BSI:PBE0/BS-I)//PBE0/
BS-II level for the real system. Then, thermodynamic quantities were
obtained by adding zero-point vibrational energies, thermal corrections,
and entropy contributions to the single-point energies. Unless otherwise
noted, relative Gibbs free energies (ΔG) at 85 °C are shown in this
article. Furthermore, some electronic structures were analyzed by the
natural bond order (NBO) method.16 All computations were fulﬁlled
with the Gaussian 09 program.17 All three-dimensional structures were
produced by the CYLview program.18

Scheme 3. Experimentally Reported Reaction (from Ref 8)

Herein, to reduce computational cost and provide a general
mechanism, a model system in which the catalyst [(t-BuXPhos)-
Au]+ and CO2Bu-t group were simpliﬁed to [AuP(Me)3]+ and
CO2Me was used for computations. Moreover, we only
considered the model reaction where R1 = CH3, R2 = H, and
MG = H.

3.1.1. Formation of Reaction Complexes. Figure 1 shows
that three possible reaction complexes could be formed in the
initial stage of the reaction. Because of low catalyst loading and a
large real ligand (t-BuXPhos), we ruled out the possibility of two
gold(I) catalysts binding to one substrate. The nitrogen of the
2H-azirine moiety is more favorable than alkyne to interact with
the gold(I) catalyst. As shown in the Supporting Information, the
second-order stabilization energy (E2) for the interaction of the
lone-pair (LP) of nitrogen with antibonding of Au−P (σ*
Au−P) is
87.99 kcal/mol in CM3, and second-order stabilization energies
are 84.59 and 23.15 kcal/mol for π
Au−P and back-
C1C2 in CM1. Note that the starting
donation of dAu
reactant complex CM1 is directly associated with the following
cyclization, and its energy is therefore set to zero in this article.
As stated in the Introduction, detailed processes for three
possible pathways (paths A, C, and D) of the title reaction are
shown in Figure 2. Two other possible pathways (Scheme 2,
structure 5 in path B and structure 12 in path E) could not be
optimized on the potential energy surface with this computa-
tional method. As a π-acid catalyst, the gold(I) catalyst ﬁrst
activates alkyne in the reaction. After 5-endo-dig cyclization, path
A is associated with direct ring expansion followed by 1,2-proton-
transfer, whereas an alternative pathway is to form a tight
intermediate (a-IM-3) in which two three-membered rings share
one edge. Then, path C corresponds to the carbocationic shift,
which could be detected in the rearrangement reaction of
cyclopropene-containing 1,5-enyne, whereas path D is the
process of 1,2-proton-transfer followed by ring-expansion.

3.1.2. Cyclization Pathways. As shown in Figure 3, two
possible reaction types, 4-exo-dig and 5-endo-dig, could exist in

the cyclization induced by the nucleophilic attack of the N atom
on the CC triple bond. The ΔG
(16.08 vs 35.06 kcal/mol)
calculated indicates that the 5-endo-dig cyclization transition state
a-TS-1 should be more favorable than the 4-exo-dig cyclization
transition state b-TS. Both imaginary frequencies mainly
correspond to the C−N bond stretch modes. Note that it is
strongly reversible for the 5-endo-dig cyclization from CM1 to a-
IM-1 via a-TS-1. Similar to the case of cyclopropene-containing
1,5-enyne, the diﬀerence in ring strain between a-TS-1 and b-TS
could be responsible for the selectivity in the cyclization step.
Therefore, it is less likely to undergo the 4-exo-dig cyclization.

CC2 and LP(N) → π*

For C−N bond formation in a-TS-1,

the second-order
stabilization energies (E2) are 18.61 and 27.06 kcal/mol for
C5N
C1C2, indicating that except
π
for the lone-pair of nitrogen the CN π bond of azirine also
partially contributed to the nucleophilic addition. Therefore,
from CM1 to a-TS-1, the C1−C2 and C5−N bonds slightly
elongate by 0.038 and 0.014 Å, respectively. The C1−N bond
length is 2.028 Å, and its Wiberg bond index is 0.304, indicating
that a-TS-1 is a reactant-like (early) transition state.
After the reaction overcomes transition state a-TS-1, it oﬀers
the intermediate a-IM1. In a-IM-1, distances of C1−C5 and N−
C1 are 2.550 and 1.474 Å, respectively. The bond angle of C1−
C2−Au is 124.04°, revealing that the gold(I) catalyst completely
binds to the C2 atom. IRC results show that the reaction
simultaneously undergoes C1−N bond formation and a shift of
the gold(I) catalyst toward the C2 atom in the 5-endo-dig
process. We found that from CM1 to a-IM-1 the natural charge
of the gold(I) catalyst decreases by ∼0.23 e, whereas the C5 atom
increases by ∼0.18 e. It turns out that the formal positive charge
should partially transfer from the gold(I) catalyst to the C5 atom,
making the C5 atom the carbocation. Next, two possibilities are
considered in our study, namely, direct ring expansion through
sequential (path A) or concerted (path B) processes and ring-
contraction through C1−C5 bond formation leading to gold
carbenoid intermediate a-IM-3.
3.1.3. Direct Ring Expansion via Paths A or B. Obviously, the
reaction can undergo C4−N ring cleavage due to the three-
membered ring strain in a-IM-1. Figure 4 shows the sequential
process (path A) and the corresponding relative free energies. In
transition state a-TS-2, the C4−N bond is elongated to 1.812 Å,
and its Wiberg bond index is reduced to 0.6114. ΔG
is only 1.96
kcal/mol in this elementary step. Then, the plane intermediate a-
IM-2, including a six-membered ring, is generated. The following

aromatization through 1,2-proton transfer was very easy with
only a small free energy barrier (ΔG
= 1.19 kcal/mol). Finally, it
is dramatically exergonic in the formation of product complex a-
PM-1.

Additionally, to verify the suggested “concerted” mechanism
(path B), as shown in the Introduction, we also started from a-
IM-1 to test this possibility. However, regardless of the initial
transition state structures we suggested, both the imaginary
vibration of transition states and IRC tracking reveal that only
one mode (ring expansion or proton-transfer, see Figure 4) can
the suggested “concerted” mechanism,
be detected. Thus,
including simultaneous ring expansion and proton-transfer,
starting from a-IM-1 is unlikely.
3.1.4. Processes after C1−C5 Bond Formation (Paths C and
D). Alternatively, the other possible process is electrophilic attack
of the carbocation at the double bond to construct a C1−C5
bond, leading to gold carbenoid intermediate a-IM-3 (Figure 5).
The corresponding transition state a-TS-4 was located at 2.133 Å
of C1−C5 bond distance and 96.42° of C1−N−C5 bond angle,
indicating that
the two planes (ﬁve-membered and three-
membered rings) are almost perpendicular. The imaginary
vibrational frequency (263.05i cm−1) is mainly associated with
the C1−C5 bond stretch mode. In a-IM-3, two three-membered
rings share one edge (N−C5 bond), and bond distances of C1−
C5 and N−C5 are 1.552 and 1.408 Å, respectively. Note that the
formation of the stable gold carbenoid a-IM-3 would beneift
‡
from the strong back-donation of gold. ΔG
of a-TS-4 is only
4.98 kcal/mol higher than that of a-TS-2, indicating that it might

be somewhat competitive to undergo C4−N ring expansion and
C1−C5 bond formation from a-IM-1. Next, we explored two
possible pathways (paths C and D) from intermediate a-IM-3 to
provide more information about the title reaction.

According to the process of cyclopropene-containing 1,5-
enyne, a 1,3-carbocationic migration pathway would exist in the
reaction and control product selectivity. Figure 5 also shows the
corresponding structures and relative free energies. Starting from
a-IM-3, the carbocation (C5) migrates to connect with the C1
and C2 atoms via double cleavage of the N−C4 and C4−C5
bonds. It would need ∼24.11 kcal/mol
to overcome the
corresponding transition state a-TS-5. After that, compared
with a-IM-1, a-IM-4 has a skeleton similar to one carbocation.
Likewise, ring expansion followed by proton-transfer would also
‡
occur in this pathway. It was found that both steps are rapid (ΔG
< 10 kcal/mol). Accordingly, the high free energy barrier (24.11
kcal/mol) of a-TS-5 could block the path C reaction.
Additionally, we could not locate the nonclassic carbocation as
found in the case of cyclopropene-containing 1,5-enyne (Figure
6). The reason for the transformation could be attributed to the
strong interaction between the electron-deﬁcient carbocation
and the electron-rich nitrogen atom.

Also starting from a-IM-3, except

for the carbocation
migration (path C) and the reverse process (path A) mentioned
above, 1,2-proton transfer (from C3 to C2) followed by ring
expansion (path D) is also tested in this work. As shown in Figure
7, proton-transfer on two diﬀerent faces has close free energy
barriers (∼20 kcal/mol). We think the closed barriers would be

rational due to little spatial hindrance using a simpliﬁed catalyst
and a small substituent at the C5 position. Next, we selected one
more stable intermediate (a-IM-6) to explore ring expansion.

of transition state a-TS-10 is too high (28.54 kcal/mol)

to undergo this ring-expansion process. In addition, starting from
a-IM-3, the “concerted” mechanism,
including simultaneous
proton-transfer and ring expansion (path B), was also analyzed.
Results indicate that this concerted mechanism could also not be

found on the potential energy surface. Overall, the high free
energy barriers reveal that it would be unlikely for the reaction to
proceed via path D.

3.1.5. Possible Reaction Process from Reaction Complex
CM3 (Path E). As mentioned above, CM3 is more stable than

CM1. Therefore, we attempted to obtain some possible
processes starting from CM3. Figure 8 shows some possible
geometries in our test. Unfortunately, ring-opening gold(I)-
nitrene intermediate A was not found to be a minimum, which
diﬀers from the cases catalyzed by Rh(I) and Fe(II) compounds.5
Furthermore, although intermediate C is unsuccessful in locating
the cyclic transition state via nucleophilic addition of nitrogen to
alkyne, its relative energy (35.57 kcal/mol at the PBE0/BS-I
level) is rather high in the absence of alkyne activation (see the
Supporting Information). Another possible geometry (B) is also
unstable on the potential energy surface and can relax to C. That
is to say, provided that the gold(I) catalyst interacts with nitrogen
of 2H-azirine, it would be impossible to catalyze the rearrange-
ment process, which is in agreement with the experiment data in

Figure 7. Relative free energy (kcal/mol) proﬁle in path D.

relative to syn-CM3 (or anti-CM3) in favored path A are shown
in the Supporting Information (Table S6). It is found that the
relative Gibbs free energies of syn-TS1, syn-IM-1, and syn-TS2
are slightly higher (∼1.5−3 kcal/mol) than those of anti-TS1,
anti-IM-1, and anti-TS2, which can be explained by steric
hindrance between the R group and −CO2CH3, because the
dihedral angle of C6−C4−C3−C7 is close to 0 in the
carbocation intermediate syn-IM-1. On the other hand, the
repulsion between the R and carbocation groups in anti-IM-1
also has little eﬀect on the relative energies. In addition, our
results indicate that the real,
large ligand tBuXPhos would
favorably occupy the syn face to eﬃciently promote the reaction
(see Figure 10 and details in the next section). In this way, it
would render large repulsion between the real ligand and the R
group if the substrate possesses a substituent group at the
propargylic syn position. Therefore, we assume that
the
selectivity of product (anti > syn) would originate from both
the ligand eﬀect and the stability of the carbocation.

3.3. Favored Process in the Real System. To evaluate the
spatial eﬀect of ligands, we investigated the real system (R1 =
 H, MG = H) as shown in Scheme 3. According to the
CH3, R2
mechanistic scenario as described above, we only considered
favored pathway A for the real system. Note that the fast proton-
transfer step is also neglected in the computations. Figure 10
shows the corresponding optimized structures. One can see that
the key structural parameters are very similar to those in the
simpliﬁed models. That is to say, without consideration of the
spatial eﬀect, it is rational to assume that the simpliﬁed ligand
(PMe3) mimics the real ligand. However, the rate-determining
step changes from 5-endo-dig in the model system to C−N bond
cleavage of ring expansion in the real system.

Furthermore, two phenyl-substituted real systems are also
considered to evaluate the electronic eﬀects. The corresponding
optimized structures are shown in the Supporting Information.
 H, MG = H), the phenyl group is

(R1 = CH3, R2 = phenyl, MG = H), the phenyl group is placed at
the alkyne terminal (C1 position). As shown in Table 1,
‡
compared with the nonsubstituted reaction, both ΔG
of the ﬁrst
step (5-endo-dig cyclization) increase by 2−3 kcal/mol in the
substituted reactions, which can be attributed to electron
delocalization reducing the nucleophilic/electrophilic activity.
For case 1, the phenyl group at the C5 atom can stabilize the
carbocation in intermediate r-IM-1, leading to the decrease in the
corresponding energy. Therefore, the rate-determining step
becomes 5-endo-dig cyclization in case 1. For case 2, the repulsion
between phenyl (at the C1 position of alkyne) and tertiary butyl
of the ligand would push the free energy barrier slightly higher.
From r-CM1 to r-IM-1 in case 2, the phenyl group rotates ∼60°,
making phenyl and tertiary butyl approach each other. Therefore,
for the transition state of ring-expansion in case 2, the distance
between the phenyl and tertiary butyl groups would be slightly
suppressed along with ring-expansion, resulting in more
repulsion. Accordingly, ΔG
of ring expansion in case 2 is 6.94
‡
kcal/mol from the intermediate, and the overall ΔG
reaches
21.79 kcal/mol, which is higher than the other two real reaction
systems described above.

Unfortunately, our computational ΔG

does not match the
experimental observations.8 In the experiment, the authors found
that the rate of the C1-substituted reaction (case 2, 90% yield
after 1.5 h) is faster than that of both the C5-substituted (case 1,
79% yield after 48 h) and nonsubstituted reactions (74% yield
after 24 h). However, our computational results show that the

which no reaction occurred without the alkynyl chain in a
substrate.6

Overall, after the formation of intermediate a-IM-1 via 5-endo-
dig cyclization, our computational results support sequential
pathway (path A), where ring expansion takes place before
proton-transfer, and suggested concerted-type pathway B cannot
be optimized in the reaction even though proton transfer is very
fast. Starting from intermediate a-IM-3, it would be diﬃcult for
two other possible pathways (paths C and D) to occur due to
much higher energy barriers. In this sense, if intermediate a-IM-3
was formed in the reaction, it would still reverse and enter the
favored path A. Therefore, no matter how high ΔG
of transition
state a-TS-4 gets, the title reaction only goes through a-TS-2 for
ring expansion. Additionally, if the dead-end reactant complex
CM3 is formed, it must transform to CM1 to catalyze the title
reaction.

Inﬂuence of the Substituent Group at the
Propargylic Position. To provide more information on the
title reaction, we tested the substituent groups (methyl, ethyl, or
isopropyl) at the propargylic position (C3) to understand their
inﬂuence on reactivity. Figure 9 shows two types of conformers
(syn and anti). Note that, due to the spatial repulsion between the
catalyst and the R group, structures of anti-CM1 cannot be
optimized and transformed to anti-CM2 when R is an ethyl or
isopropyl group. In this sense, the corresponding energies

reaction of case 2 has higher relative free energy from r-CM3
(27.75 kcal/mol). We therefore turn our attention to the binding
energy of product complexes. We found that the binding energy
of the product complex would have an important eﬀect on the
reaction rate. As shown in the Supporting Information (Table
S4), CH3 and phenyl at the C5 and C1 positions, respectively, in
case 2 result in more repulsion between product and ligand in the
product complex (r-PM-2). Compared to case 1, the binding
energy of r-PM-2 in case 2 decreases by ∼5.5 kcal/mol.
Accordingly, it is easy to exchange product for reactant in the
reaction of case 2, whereas for the other two reactions need more
time for product exchange due to their binding energies of
product complexes being higher than those of the reactant

4. CONCLUSION
We have investigated the whole mechanism for gold(I)-catalyzed
rearrangement of 2-propargyl 2H-azirines to pyridines using the
DFT method. Five possible pathways have been explored for the
reaction. Our results indicate that the arrangement reaction
could be eﬃciently promoted by the gold(I) catalyst through the
favored sequential pathway (path A). After 1,5-endo-dig
cyclization by nucleophilic attack, direct ring expansion (C−N
bond cleavage) followed by 1,2-proton transfer could furnish
pyridine in the reaction. Because of the anti or syn conformer of
the migration group (MG), the selectivity of product could be
explained by the hindrance of ligand (t-BuXPhos) and stability of

the carbocation. Moreover, the suggested concerted reaction
mechanism (path B), including simultaneous ring-expansion and
proton transfer, could not be optimized. We found that the
binding energy between the product and gold(I) catalyst could
account for the observed reaction rate.

It is found that, although the
dispersion energies calculated by the DFT-D3 code are ∼22 kcal/mol in
all relevant optimized geometries in the model system, the relative
dispersion energies are too low and have little effect on our results (see
Table S5 in the Supporting Information). (c) Grimme, S.; Antony, J.;
