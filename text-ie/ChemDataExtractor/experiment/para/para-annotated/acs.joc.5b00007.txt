ABSTRACT: The 3+1 condensation of symmetrical 16-
Selena/telluratripyrranes with symmetrical selenophene-2,5-
diols/tellurophene-2,5-diols in the presence of BF3-etheratre
or BF3-methanol followed by oxidation with DDQ gave 5,10-
porphodimethenes, whereas the process with unsymmetrical
selenophene-2,5-diols/tellurophene-2,5-diols gave 5-porpho-
methenes. In addition, the reaction of unsymmetrical 16-
Selena/telluratripyrranes with symmetrical selenophene-2,5-
diols/tellurophene-2,5-diols gave the corresponding porpho-
trimethenes, whereas
the process with unsymmetrical
selenophene-2,5-diols/tellurophene-2,5-diols gave the 5,15-
porphodimethenes. The structures of diﬀerent products were
characterized by IR, 1H and 13C NMR, 1H−1H COSY, CHN analysis, and mass spectrometry. The binding of mercury with the
calix[4]phyrins mentioned above had been observed in the decreasing order of porphodimethenes > porphomethenes >
porphotrimethenes by UV−vis and 1H NMR spectroscopy.

■ INTRODUCTION

the presence of

the sp3-hybridized unit,

Porphomethenes, porphodimethenes, and porphotrimethenes
are the classes of calixphyrins in which porphomethene
[calix(4)phyrin-(1.1.1.1)] contains one sp2-hybridized meso-
carbon atom and three sp3-hybridized meso-carbon atoms,
porphodimethene [calix(4)phyrin-(1.1.1.1 and 1.1.1.1)] con-
tains two sp2-hybridized and two sp3-hybridized meso-carbon
atoms, and porphotrimethene [calix(4)phyrin-(1.1.1.1)] con-
tains three sp2-hybridized meso-carbon atoms and one sp3-
hybridized meso-carbon atom (Figure 1).1 The presence of sp3-
hybridized meso-carbon centers disrupts the π-conjugation and
allows the macrocycle to adapt a nonplanar conformation;2
because of
these
compounds display an intriguing multielectron redox chem-
istry.3 Calix[4]phyrins consist of the intermediate structure of
porphyrin and calix[4]pyrrole;
they have properties
analogous to those of both porphyrins and calix[4]pyrroles
ion receptors4 and anion-
and play diverse roles as metal
complexing agents5 and reveal a rich coordination chemistry.6
However,

spectroscopic properties of these macrocycles in comparison
to those of the porphyrins.7 Naturally, calix[4]phyrins have
been proposed as intermediates in the synthesis of chlorophyll
a,1b,c heme P460,8 chlorins,9 and porphyrins.9b Calix[4]phyrin
was recently identiﬁed as a potential chemical
inhibitor of
uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase and reduced the viability of
cancer cells.10 Calix[4]phyrins have been synthesized by

the lack of π-conjugation compromises

thus,

reductive alkylation of porphyrins,11 dealkylation of calix[4]-
pyrroles,12 oxidation of porphyrinogens,13 and reduction of
porphyrins.14 The methods described above require expansive
reagents, multistep synthesis, and vigorous reaction conditions.
Recently, calix[4]phyrins have been synthesized by reaction
of 5,5-disubstituted dipyrromethane and aldehyde or by
reaction of 5-substituted dipyrromethane and ketone under
acidic conditions followed by oxidation with DDQ, chloranil, or
FeCl3 under mild conditions.15 The introduction of diﬀerent

Modiﬁcation of the calix[4]phyrin core by replacement of
one or two nitrogen atoms with donor atoms15 (O, S, and P)
leads to the synthesis of core-modiﬁed calix[4]phyrins.16 The
porphodimethenes are stable, and their properties have been
extensively studied; on the other hand, core-modiﬁed
porphomethenes and porphotrimethenes (Figure 1) have
remained unexplored because of the instability and complexity

porphyrinoids and their derivatives keep attracting the attention

Acetylenic coupling is an important tool for the synthesis of

homocoupling of 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol (1a) to give diynediol
(2a).22 Diynediol (2a) reacts with Na2Se in the presence of
silver acetate to give 2,5-bis[hydroxy(dimethyl)methyl]-
selenophene (3a). The structure of 3a was fully conﬁrmed by
1H NMR and comparison of other spectroscopic data from the
literature.20 Similarly, other selenophene and tellurophene diols
(3b−h) were synthesized and characterized. Selenophene diol
3a reacts with an excess of pyrrole to give 16-selenatripyrrane
(4a) in 75% yield. Similarly, 16-telluratripyrrane (4b) was
synthesized and characterized by various
spectroscopic
techniques in 78% yield (Scheme 1).

The 3+1 condensation is an important method for the
synthesis of selected porphyrins15c and core-modiﬁed porphyr-
ins.15,20,23 The 3+1 condensation of 1 equiv of tripyrranes (4a)
with 1 equiv of corresponding diols (3c) in the presence of
BF3-etherate in dichloromethane (3.2 mM) at room temper-
ature in 30 min, followed by treatment with 2.2 equiv of 2,3-
dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ), gave the new
selenium core-modiﬁed 5,5,10,10-tetramethyl-15,20-bisphenyl-
21,23-diselenaporphodimethene [5a (Scheme 1, method A)].
From the reaction, a mixture of two calixphyrins, 5a and 8a, was
the π-
obtained. On the basis of
conjugated moiety, 8a is classiﬁed as a 2e−-oxidized product
(14π) and 5a as a 4e−-oxidized product (16π).15b In the high-
resolution mass spectra, peaks corresponding to 8a along with
5a were observed (see the Supporting Information), and TLC
analysis of the crude reaction mixture indicated that product 5a
was a predominant product of this condensation. However, all
attempts to isolate 8a from the reaction mixture resulted in its
decomposition, and only 16π-conjugated system 5a was
isolated by column chromatography in 10% yield. Even with
a decrease in the amount of oxidant from 2 to 0.5 equiv, no
signiﬁcant improvements were observed in the yield of 8a. The
greater selectivity of the 16π-conjugated system (4e−-oxidized)
and the instability of the 14π-conjugated system (2e−-oxidized)
may be explained on the basis of weak hydrogen bonding
interaction of the lone pair (Se) with the pyrrolic NH proton
(X···H−N, where X = Se or Te) or its absence in 8a; therefore,
stabilization of the 14π system is not possible. Sulfur and
oxygen core-modiﬁed calixphyrins showed greater stability of
the 14π-conjugated system in comparison to that of 16π, which
may arise from the repulsive or attractive electrostatic
interactions between the core heteroatoms and the pyrrole
NH groups.15b,c Similarly, the other porphodimethenes (5b−d)
were synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic
techniques.

On the other hand, sp2-hybridized meso-methyl-substituted
porphodimethene (5e and 5f) and sp2-hybridized meso-
unsubstituted porphodimethene (5g and 5h) could not be

In some cases, the HRMS analysis of the reaction mixture
revealed the formation of desired porphyrinogen intermediates
(7e−h), which disappeared without providing corresponding
porphodimethene products upon oxidation with DDQ or p-
chloranil. To understand the detailed mechanism of reaction,
the intermediate porphyrinogens (7e−h) were isolated and
characterized. These porphyrinogens (7e−h) were further
oxidized under neutral conditions. Porphodimethenes (5e−h)
were obtained by condensation of 1 equiv of tripyrranes (4a
and 4b) with 1 equiv of the corresponding diol (3e−h) in the
presence of BF3-methanol using dichloromethane as a solvent
(3.2 mM) at 0 °C for 1 h, and then the reaction mixture was

porphyrinogens were puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatog-
raphy to aﬀord white solids in 10−14% yield. The methyl-
substituted porphyrinogens (7e and 7f) were oxidized with
chloranil, and meso-unsubstituted porphyrinogens (7g and 7h)
were oxidized with 0.1% aqueous FeCl3 in CHCl3 at room

tellurium-embedded porphodimethenes 5b, 5d, 5f, and 5h were

meso tetramethyl chemical shifts and the splitting pattern
between Te and Se calixphyrins reﬂects the diﬀerence in the
degree of distortion in their conformation; this may be ascribed
to the diﬀerence in sizes of Se/Te incorporated in their π-
conjugated N-X-N subunits. The UV−vis absorption spectra of
Se hybrids 5a, 5c, 5e and 5g showed the transitions at lower
wavelengths at around 343 and 520 nm. For Te hybrids 5b, 5d,
5f, and 5h in CH2Cl2, broad absorptions due to π−π*
transitions were observed around 561−559 nm along with an
intense band around 360−358 nm (Supporting Information).
Unsubstituted 15,20-meso-carbon porphodimethenes (5g and
5h) are highly unstable and very diﬃcult to handle and become
dark at
room temperature in comparison to 15,20-meso-
substituted porphodimethene.

The cross coupling of haloalkyne with a terminal alkyne
catalyzed by Cu(I) is the most important method for the
synthesis of unsymmetrical diynes (Scheme 3).24 Although the
nickel-catalyzed oxidative coupling reaction of two diﬀerent
terminal alkynes using O2 as the oxidant at room temperature
has been reported for the facile synthesis of unsymmetrical
diynes,21 the symmetrical diynes are also formed and separated
from the reaction mixture. The reaction of 1 equiv of
unsymmetrical diols (9a) with 1 equiv of corresponding 16-
selenatripyrranes (4a) in dichloromethane (method A) gave
porphomethenes 6a in 9% yield (Scheme 1). Similarly,
ditelluraporphomethene (6b) was obtained in 7% yield. The
absorption spectra of ditelluraporphomethene (564 and 360
nm) and diselenaporphomethene (440 and 328 nm) were quite
similar to the absorption spectra of ditellura/diselenaporpho-
dimethene. In the 1H NMR spectra of selenaporphomethene
(6a), the four β-pyrrole protons appeared as two sets of
multiplets in the range of δ 6.0−6.3, and two diﬀerent β-
selenophene protons appeared as a multiplet and a singlet at δ
6.9 and 7.1, respectively (Supporting Information).

The reaction of unsymmetrical 16-selenatripyrrane (10a) and
symmetrical selenophene diols (3c) in dichloromethane, in the
presence of a catalytic amount of triﬂuoroacetic acid at room
temperature,
followed by oxidation with DDQ gave the
porphotrimethene (11a) in 9% yield. The presence of a strong
M+ ion peak in the mass spectra and correct elemental analysis
conﬁrmed the synthesis of phlorin (11a). Similarly, the other
porphotrimethene 11b was synthesized in 11% yield and
characterized by IR, NMR, and UV−vis spectroscopy. Phlorins
11a and 11b are quite stable under nitrogen and isolable
(Scheme 3).

The 1H NMR data of 11b are typical for a nonaromatic
conjugated system with four sets of signals of four β-pyrrole
protons in the range of δ 6.3−7.1 as compared to the 21,23-
ditelluraporphyrins.18c,d The four β-tellurophene protons
appeared as two sets of signals: a doublet at δ 7.5 and a
multiplet at δ 7.6. The inner NH proton showed two broad
signals at δ 11.2 and 12.2 that were attributed tentatively to the
presence of tautomers in solution. However, when the 1H
NMR spectrum was
recorded using deuterated pyridine
(C5D5N) as a solvent, only one broad signal at δ 10.2 was
observed, which disappeared upon addition of a drop of D2O
(exchange of
the NH proton with a deuterium atom),

The reaction of unsymmetrical 16-selenatripyrrane (10a)
with unsymmetrical selenophene diols (9a) in dichloro-
methane, in the presence of triﬂuoroacetic acid (1.5h), followed
by DDQ oxidation gave the newer 5,15-porphodimethene

terized by UV−vis, 1H NMR, and correct elemental analysis.
The 1H NMR spectra of both the compounds are in good
agreement for the given structure. Similarly, the other 5,15-
porphodimethene (12b) was synthesized (Scheme 3). The
electronic absorption spectrum of 5,15-diselenaporphodime-
thene 12a is quite diﬀerent from that of 5,10-diselenaporpho-
dimethene 5a. The UV−vis spectrum of 5a showed two sharp
peaks at 343 and 520 nm, whereas in the UV−vis spectrum of
12a, a broad peak at 426 nm along with a shoulder at 525 nm
was observed. It is quite understandable due to the presence of
conjugated double bonds in diselenaporphodimethene 5a.
Compared to those of 5,10-porphodimethene (5a), the 1H

The problematic role of mercury for the environment has
necessitated the investigation of the detection of mercury with
suitable chemosensors.25 The chalcogenophilicity of mercury
led to the development of various sensors from compounds
containing chalcogen atoms. Chalcogen−mercury binding is
stronger than chalcogen−zinc or chalcogen−magnesium bind-
ing because of the strong relativistic 6s orbital contraction that
draws the chalcogen charge to the Hg2+ nucleus.25 The greater
stability of phenyl-substituted calixphyrin among those of other
calixphyrins oﬀers the further utilization of these compounds in
the selective detection of mercury. The electronic absorption
spectroscopic titration of 5,10-porphodimethene 5a with a
“soft” Lewis acid, mercuric perchlorate Hg(ClO4)2, was
performed in an acetonitrile/water mixture [6:4 (v/v)] at
room temperature. Calixphyrin 5a gave characteristic absorp-
tion maxima at 339 and 514 nm, and upon addition of Hg2+ in
an acetonitrile/water solution [6:4 (v/v)] of 5a (1:1 complex),
the absorption peak was bathochromically shifted to 415 and
584 nm (shifted by 70 nm) with the increase in relative
intensity (Figure 2). The bright red solution of 5a turned gray
upon complexation with Hg2+, and the color changes were
clearly visible to the naked eye. The binding constant for the
formation of the 1:1 complex from the interaction of 5a and
Hg2+ was calculated from the plot of 1/(A − A0) versus 1/
[Hg2+] using the Benesi−Hildebrand equation26 and was found
to be 1.37 × 107 M−1. The linearity of
further
conﬁrmed the 1:1 binding stoichiometry. The UV−vis
absorption response of 5a was also examined in the presence
of 1−100 equiv of various metal ions such as K+, Ag+, Mn2+,
Cu2+, Pb2+, Cr2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ in an acetonitrile/water
solution [6:4 (v/v)] (Supporting Information). No signiﬁcant
changes in UV−vis intensity were observed with these metal
ions, which indicated the selective chelation of Hg2+ with 5a
(Figure S15 of the Supporting Information).

ﬂuorescence was gradually quenched upon the stepwise
addition of Hg2+ (from 0.5 to 5.0 μm) to a solution of 5a (2
μm) (Figure 3). The ﬂuorescence quenching upon addition of
Hg2+ was attributed to the formation of a complex between 5a
and Hg2+.27 The ﬂuorescence response of 5a was also examined
in the presence of 1−100 equiv of various metal ions such as
K+, Ag+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Pb2+, Cr2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ in an

with 1 equiv of Hg2+. Hence, selective chelation of Hg2+ with 5a
was observed.

The electronic absorption spectroscopic titration of 5b with
Hg2+ was also performed, and their respective preliminary peaks
were shifted by 18−20 nm. The binding constant was

of 5a and 5b were calculated for Hg2+ ions, and we found that
5a (1.1 × 10−7 M) showed a detection limit higher than that of
5b (3.2 × 10−6 M) (Figures S19 and S20 of the Supporting

were observed (Figures S20 and S21 of

The 1H NMR spectrum of selenium calixphyrin with Hg2+ at
298 K was recorded (Figure 5 and Table S1 of the Supporting

observed for selenophene protons (conjugated and uncon-
jugated) and pyrrolic protons of 5a. 5a exhibited conjugated
and unconjugated selenophene protons at 7.07 and 6.91 ppm,
respectively, and pyrrolic protons at 6.67−6.71 ppm that were
signiﬁcantly downﬁeld shifted to 7.45, 7.26, and 6.71−6.74

place through the selenium of selenophene (conjugated and

■ CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, the ﬁrst syntheses of 21,23-diselena/ditellura
core-modiﬁed porphomethenes, 5,10-porphodimethenes, 5,15-
porphodimethenes, and porphotrimethenes (phlorins) have
been achieved from easily available precursors. The reaction
approach using readily available conjugated diynes as starting
materials makes this strategy highly attractive in diversity-
oriented synthesis. The diﬀerent selenium-substituted calix[4]-
phyrins are more stable than tellurium-substituted calix[4]-
phyrins, and these calixphyrins have shown better selectivity for
Hg2+. The binding ability of calixphyrins with Hg2+ ion has
been examined by using 1H NMR, UV−vis, and ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy.

General Experimental Details. Melting points were determined
on a capillary melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. The
chemical shifts (δ) are referenced to the respective solvents, and
splitting patterns are designed as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), m
(multiplet), dt (double triplet), br (broad), and brs (broad singlet).
Coupling constants (J) are reported in hertz. The mass spectra of
selected compounds were recorded on an Agilent Technologies high-

General Procedure for the Sensing of Hg2+ with Calixphyr-
ins. All the experiments were conducted at an ambient temperature of
25 °C. For every experiment, a fresh solution was prepared. The
solution of calixphyrins in acetonitrile (2 mL) was taken in a
spectrophotometer cuvette, and the absorption spectrum was
recorded. A 20 μL stock solution of Hg(ClO4)2 with a similar
concentration was added to the cuvette and mixed well, and the
absorption spectrum was recorded. Similarly, a mercury solution was
added to the cuvette until the absorption spectrum began to change. In
addition, the binding constant was calculated by using the Benesi−
Hilderbrand equation.
