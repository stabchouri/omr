ABSTRACT: PdCl2(CH3CN)2-catalyzed arylation of unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds using (diacetoxyiodo)arenes as arylation
reagents is reported. The reactivity of (diacetoxyiodo)arenes as arylation reagents is enabled in the presence of Cs2CO3 under the
reaction conditions. This arylation method is highly eﬃcient and occurs without the use of silver salt. The reaction tolerates a
broad substrate scope that was not demonstrated by other silver salt-free C(sp3)−H bond arylation conditions. The synthetic
utility of the method is further illustrated in the synthesis of the psychotropic drug phenibut. A detailed mechanism study has
been conducted to understand the reaction pathway.

■ INTRODUCTION
C(sp3)−C(sp2) bonds are present
in a broad range of
pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals, and synthetic inter-
mediates. Direct construction of C(sp3)−C(sp2) bonds through
C(sp3)−H bond activation is an increasingly frequent strategy
since it eliminates the need to prefunctionalize substrates and,
therefore, shortens synthetic sequences.1 Recent years have
seen signiﬁcant advances in transition-metal-catalyzed direct
arylation of unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds using an auxiliary-
directing strategy2,3 or a ligand-control strategy.4 In these
arylation methods, the catalyst is usually palladium,2−4 iron,5 or
nickel,6 and the arylation reagents are typically aryl halides.
When aryl halides are used for this purpose, such reactions
usually require a stoichiometric amount of expensive silver salts
as halide scavengers.2c−g,3 As a result, this generates a signiﬁcant
amount of toxic silver metal waste and increases the cost and
diﬃculty of synthetic processes. To avoid these disadvantages,
many laboratories have been working to develop silver salt-free
conditions for arylation of C(sp3)−H bonds, exempliﬁed by
recent excellent reports.7 Nevertheless, new silver salt-free
conditions to expand the scope and limitations of the current
methods are highly desired.

(Diacetoxyiodo)arenes play important roles as reagents in
many organic transformations with great
stability, wide
availability, and low toxicity.8 It has already proven useful as
acetoxylation reagents in palladium-catalyzed acetoxylation of
C−H bonds.9 To the best of our knowledge, no example of

using (diacetoxyiodo)arenes as arylation reagents in arylating
unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds has been reported, despite recent
examples of arylating C(sp2)−H bonds.10 Here, we describe the
ﬁrst use of (diacetoxyiodo)arenes to arylate unactivated β-
C(sp3)−H bonds of carboxylic acid derivatives (Scheme 1).
Scheme 1. Arylation of Unactivated C(sp3)−H Bonds by
(Diacetoxyiodo)arenes

The reaction relies on 8-aminoquinoline, a powerful bidentate
directing group that was ﬁrst reported by Daugulis and co-
workers in β-arylation of carboxylic acid derivatives and was
subsequently adapted to many other C−H activation
reactions.3

reaction could, in principle, generate arylation product 3aa or
acetoxylation product 4aa. Screening various solvents in the
presence of Pd(OAc)2 as catalyst and Cs2CO3 as base, we
found that the solvent inﬂuenced the relative proportions of
arylation and acetoxylation products (Table 1, entries 1−6).
Mesitylene proved optimal for aﬀording 3aa exclusively (Table
1, entry 6). Of the various palladium catalysts screened (Table
1, entries 7−11), PdCl2(CH3CN)2 improved the yield of 3aa to
86% (Table 1, entry 11). We further investigated the eﬀects of
base on reaction eﬃciency. Omitting Cs2CO3 from the reaction
gave acetoxylation product 4aa exclusively in 36% yield (Table
1, entry 12). Bases composed of diﬀerent cations or anions
from Cs2CO3 gave low yields of 3aa (Table 1, entries 13−18).
Lowering the reaction temperature to 90 °C resulted in trace
amounts of 3aa (Table 1, entry 19). In the end, the optimal
reaction conditions to obtain arylation product 3aa were
PdCl2(CH3CN)2 (10 mol %), PhI(OAc)2 (2.5 equiv), and
Cs2CO3 (4.0 equiv) in mesitylene at 110 °C.

isopropylamine (IV).7c It turned out that only IV aﬀorded the
desired arylation product in moderate 60% yield. None of the
other directing groups gave any arylation product. The
bidentate chelation nature of 8-aminoquinoline as directing
group was conﬁrmed by the fact that N-methyl-N-(quinolin-8-
yl)butyramide (V) or N-(naphthalen-1-yl)butyramide (VI),
which lack bidentate chelation ability, did not aﬀord any
arylation product. In this study, 8-aminoquinoline was superior
to other directing groups in assisting arylation of the β-C(sp3)−
H bond of butyric acid derivatives by PhI(OAc)2.

With the optimal reaction conditions in hand, we examined
the scope of (diacetoxyiodo)arenes in the arylation of 1a
(Table 4). We were delighted to ﬁnd that various para-, meta-,
and ortho-substituted (diacetoxyiodo)arenes were well toler-
ated. All para-substituted (diacetoxyiodo)arenes with either
electron-rich or electron-deﬁcient groups aﬀorded the desired
arylation products in good yields (Table 4, 3ab−3ai). Meta-
substituted (diacetoxyiodo)arenes also worked smoothly to
give the desired products in good yields (Table 4, 3aj−3am).
Notably, sterically hindered ortho-substituted (diacetoxyiodo)-

arene also performed eﬃciently, though it gave the desired
product in moderate yield (Table 4, 3an). The substrate scope
even included very electron-deﬁcient dihalogen-substituted
(diacetoxyiodo)arenes (Table 4, 3ao−3ap). Various functional
groups including F, Cl, Br, CN, and CO2Me survived under the
reaction conditions, and they could be utilized as useful handles
for downstream transformations.

Additionally, we investigated the scope of carboxylic acid

Simple aliphatic carboxylic acid derivatives were well tolerated,
aﬀording the arylation products in excellent yields (Table 5,
3ba−3ca). Phenyl and benzyl analogues also worked, though
they gave the products in moderate yields presumably due to
their unfavorable electronic or steric properties (Table 5, 3da−
3ea). In comparison, branched alkyl and cycloalkyl derivatives
exhibited good reactivity (Table 5, 3fa−3ha). In addition,
substrates with functional groups including protected alcohols,
protected amines, and ester also performed well to aﬀord the
arylation products in good yields (Table 5, 3ia−3ja, 3ka−3ma,

remarkable that our arylation conditions tolerated a variety of
useful functional groups that were not demonstrated in other
silver salt-free C(sp3)−H bond arylation approaches using aryl
iodides as arylation reagents.7 Arylation of a primary C(sp3)−H

decomposition of (p-CO2Me)PhI(OAc)2 (2g) into (p-

°C). The product 3ag did not start
the
decomposition of 2g into (p-CO2Me)PhI was complete (after
50 min), and the reaction was ﬁnished in 40 h, during which (p-
CO2Me)PhI remained constantly as the major component of
the reaction mixture (see the Supporting Information). The
above results suggested that the actual arylation reagent of the
reaction may be aryl iodides. However, simply replacing (p-
CO2Me)PhI(OAc)2 (2g) with (p-CO2Me)PhI without modify-
ing other reaction parameters only aﬀorded 13% 3ag, which
was consistent with one catalytic turnover of the palladium(II)
catalyst (Scheme 3, a). This result promoted us to hypothesize
the other role of (diacetoxyiodo)arenes in the reaction. We
thought that the acetoxy anions, another byproduct generated
from the decomposition of (diacetoxyiodo)arenes, could have
acted as ligand to reactivate the palladium catalyst. Indeed, this
hypothesis was conﬁrmed in an additional control experiment
(Scheme 3, b). In this experiment, the reaction aﬀorded 3ag in
87% yield by further replacing Cs2CO3 with CsOAc and using
(p-CO2Me)PhI as arylation reagent. Therefore, we concluded
that the (diacetoxyiodo)arenes played dual roles not only as the
arylation reagent but also as the promoter of the palladium
catalysis in that it provided the source of acetoxy anions. The
kinetic isotope experiments (parallel intermolecular KIE = 1.17,
one-pot intermolecular KIE = 3.17, intramolecular KIE = 3.07;
see the Supporting Information) suggested that the cleavage of
the β-C(sp3)−H bond of the substrate occurred as part of the
reaction pathway, but not the rate-limiting step.14 Overall, it
was noteworthy that our method avoided the use of silver salts
which were commonly utilized to assist the catalytic cycle in the
C(sp3)−H bond arylation conditions,2 , 3
since the
(diacetoxyiodo)arenes acted not only as the arylation reagent

3-Phenyl-N-(quinolin-8-yl)propanamide-3,3-D2.

General Synthetic Procedure of Arylation. A 10 mL Teﬂon-
capped vial was charged with 1 (0.2 mmol), PdCl2(CH3CN)2 (10 mol
%), 2 (0.5 mmol), CsCO3 (0.8 mmol), and mesitylene (1.0 mL) under

an air atmosphere. The vial was then tightly capped. The mixture was
stirred at room temperature for 1 min for proper mixing of the
reactants, and then heated at 110 °C with vigorous stirring. The
progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC. Upon completion, the
reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted with ethyl
acetate, and ﬁltered through a small pad of Celite. The ﬁltrate was
concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was puriﬁed by
ﬂash chromatography on silica gel (EtOAc/petroleum ether) to aﬀord
the desired product 3.

3-Phenyl-N-(quinolin-8-yl)butanamide (3aa). The title com-
pound 3aa was prepared according to the general procedure as a

Synthesis of Drug Molecule Phenibut. A mixture of 3ma (1 g)
and 12 N HCl (20 mL) was vigorously stirred at 130 °C. After this
period, the mixture was made basic with 1 N aqueous NaOH solution,
and extracted with DCM for 3 times. Afterward, the aqueous layer was
acidiﬁed by conc. HCl and concentrated at reduced pressure. The
resulting solid was taken up in MeOH and ﬁltered. Finally, the ﬁltrate
was concentrated under reduced pressure to give the desired product
4ma as a white solid (585 mg, 95%); Rf = 0.30 (CH2Cl2/MeOH 3:1);
mp 95−96 °C; 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, ppm): δ = 7.60−7.18 (m,

(EI) m/z Calcd for C17H20ClNO2 (M)+: 305.1183, found: 305.1174;
IR (neat, cm−1) ν = 3384, 2923, 2852, 1684, 1432, 1248, 749, 698.
A mixture of 4ma (100 mg) and Pd/C (10%, 20 mg) in MeOH (5
mL) was stirred under H2 pressure (1 atm) at room temperature until
the reaction was complete (TLC control). The mixture was then
ﬁltered via a small pad of Celite and washed with MeOH (10 mL).
The combined ﬁltrate was concentrated in vacuum to give
(±)-phenibut (63 mg, 90%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O, ppm): δ =
7.52−7.30 (m, 5H), 3.51−3.20 (m, 2H), 3.31−3.20 (m, 1H), 2.94−
