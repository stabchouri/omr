ABSTRACT: An auxiliary-enabled Pd-catalyzed highly regio- and stereoselective sp3 C−H activation and the direct arylation of
the C3-position of oxygen heterocycles, such as tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-benzodioxane systems, are reported. An eﬃcient
stereoselective construction of cis 2,3-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran derivatives (analogues of norlignans) and cis 2,3-
disubstituted 1,4-benzodioxane derivatives (analogues of neolignans) is described. The direct C(sp3)−H arylation of the C3-
position of (R)- or (S)- tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxamides furnished the corresponding (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) C3-arylated THF
scaﬀolds as major compounds with very high regio- and diastereoselectivities. The stereochemistry of the products obtained in
this work were unambiguously assigned on the basis of the X-ray structure analyses of representative compounds 3b, 3e, 4p, and
7.

■ INTRODUCTION

Saturated oxygen hetereocycles, especially,
tetrahydrofuran
(THF)- and benzodioxane-based motifs are recurrently
encountered in nature (e.g., lignans, annonaceous acetogenins,
polyether ionophores/antibiotics, and macrodiolides), pharma-
ceuticals, and bioactive synthetic compounds.1,2 Several
substituted THF- and benzodioxane-based synthetic molecules
and naturally occurring lignan, neolignan, and norlignan oxygen
hetereocycles were found to exhibit a wide range of biological
activities (e.g., anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-
inﬂammatory, and immunosuppressive activities).1−4 There
exist several naturally occurring THF−norlignan and benzo-
dioxane−neolignan motifs possessing an aryl group at the C3-
position (Figure 1), and many of them were found to exhibit
various biological activities.1,2 For example, recently, a family of
THF−norlignans, such as metasequirins A, B, E, F, G, and H,
were isolated2a−c and metasequirins E and F were evaluated for
lines.2a Further,
cytotoxicity against ﬁve human tumor cell
benzodioxane−neolignan molecules, such as isoamericanol A,
americanol A, isoamericanin A, and americanin A, were found
to show neurotropic and acetylcholine-enhancing activities.2d,e

The present investigation deals on the synthesis of analogues of
norlignans and neolignans.

Due to their prevalence in natural products, biological
activities, and ability to serve as building blocks in organic
chemistry, numerous classical and modern stereoselective
synthetic methods1−4 including α-C−H functionalization5
have been developed for producing bioactive and synthetic
tetrahydrofuran and benzodioxane derivatives. In general, the
majority of the tetrahydrofuran and benzodioxane derivatives
were assembled mainly via the cyclization reaction3,4 of
predesigned starting materials having the required functional
groups.
The direct functionalization of the unactivated C(sp3)−H
bonds of organic molecules is known to be a challenging task in
the past decades. However, from the recent past decade, several
exceptional reports appeared on the transition metal-catalyzed
direct
in organic
molecules, and indeed, functionalization of organic molecules
via C−H activation is emerging as one of
the important

In continuation of our lab’s interest in C−H activation
reactions, herein we report an auxiliary-enabled, Pd-catalyzed,
highly regio- and stereoselective C(sp3)−H activation/
functionalization of the tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-benzodioxane
systems. This work demonstrates a new route for the direct
arylation of the C(3) position of oxygen heterocycles, such as
tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-benzodioxane systems and highly
stereoselective construction of novel norlignan-type cis 2,3-
disubstituted tetrahydrofurans and neolignan-type cis 2,3-

dealing with the direct functionalization of C(sp2)−H bonds
present in organic molecules. On the other hand, the direct
functionalization of the unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds present
in organic molecules is one of the emerging research areas.6−15
Notably, an auxiliary-enabled, Pd-catalyzed arylation reaction of
alkyl C(sp3)−H bonds instigated by Daugulis, Yu, Chen, and
others is emerging as one of
the seminal methods for
constructing C−C bonds. Along this line, the direct arylations
of C(sp3)−H bonds present in carbocyclic systems, such as
cyclopropane, cyclobutane, medium-sized rings, the norbor-
nane framework, and acyclic amino acid derivatives, have been
successfully demonstrated by various research groups.14,15

functionalization and the direct arylation of the unactivated
C(sp3)−H bonds present in the THF and 1,4-benzodioxane

the best of our knowledge, there exist only rare papers dealing
with the directing group-enabled, Pd-catalyzed C−H function-
the unactivated C(sp3)−H bonds of saturated

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
To examine the arylation of the methylene C(sp3)−H bond of
oxygen heterocycles,
tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-
benzodioxane systems, initially, we prepared the substrate 1a
by linking tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylic acid chloride with
Daugulis’s bidentate directing group (8-aminoquinoline).14a,b
Then to ﬁnd out the best reaction conditions for achieving the
C(3)−H arylation of substrate 1a, we performed several
reactions as shown in Table 1. We found the best reaction
conditions comprising the reaction of substrate 1a, aryl iodide
2a, and AgOAc (additive) in the presence 5 or 10 mol % of the
Pd(OAc)2 catalyst, which aﬀorded the C3-arylated product, cis
2,3-disubstituted tetrahydrofuran 3a (norlignan analogue), in
70 and 81% yields, respectively (entries 3 and 4, Table 1). The

Ag2CO3 as an additive instead of AgOAc also gave the product
3a in 69% yield (entry 5, Table 1).

<para sub=“opt”>
The Pd-catalyzed C(3)−H arylation of substrate 1a with 2a
in the presence of various other additives, such as K2CO3 or
KOAc or PhI(OAc)2 did not give the product 3a (entries 6−8,
Table 1). The C−H arylation of substrate 1a in the presence of
other palladium catalysts, such as PdCl2 or Pd(TFA)2 instead of
Pd(OAc)2, did not give satisfactory yields (entries 9 and 10,
Table 1). However, the C−H arylation of 1a in the presence of
Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 and Pd(PPh3)4
instead of Pd(OAc)2
furnished the product 3a in 69 and 30% yields, respectively
(entries 11 and 12, Table 1). The Pd-catalyzed C−H arylation
of 1a with 2a in other solvents, such as MeCN or 1,2-DCE or
tert-butyl alcohol, failed to aﬀord the product 3a (entries 13−
15, Table 1). However, the Pd-catalyzed reaction of 1a with 2a
in 1,4-dioxane or tert-amyl alcohol gave the product 3a in 46
and 57% yields, respectively (entries 16 and 17, Table 1).
Employing coupling partners 2b or 2c instead of 2a was
ineﬀective (entry 18, Table 1).

To ﬁnd out how many equivalents of aryl

arylation of substrate 1a with 1 equiv of 2a gave the C3-arylated
product 3a in low yield (35%, entry 1, Table 2). Next, the Pd-
catalyzed C−H arylation of substrate 1a with 2 or 3 equiv of 2a
gave the C3-arylated product 3a in 59% and 68% yields,
respectively (entries 2 and 3, Table 2). The usage of 4 equiv of
2a gave the C3-arylated product 3a in very good yield (81%,
entry 4, Tables 1 and 2). Along this line, we have also
performed the Pd-catalyzed C−H arylation of substrate 1a with
1.8 equiv of 2a by using Bull’s reaction conditions,15c which
gave the C3-arylated product 3a in 50% yield (Table 2).

substrate 1a with multisubstituted aryl

corresponding products 3j−l in 40−58% yields. We have also
carried out the Pd-catalyzed direct arylation of the C(3)-

Representatively, recrystallization of C−H arylated products
3b and 3e formed single crystals, which were subjected to
single-crystal X-ray structure analyses. The X-ray structures of
the representative compounds 3b and 3e (see SI for the X-ray
structures of 3b and 3e)16 unambiguously conﬁrmed that all
these reactions were highly regio- and stereoselective and the
direct C−H arylation occurred only at the C3-position of the
substrate 1a and selectively gave the 2,3-disubstituted
tetrahydrofurans 3a−r having cis stereochemistry (C2 and C3
stereocenters). In addition, characteristically, the C2 proton of
all the compounds (3a−r) appeared as a doublet (chemical
shift value range, δ = 4.71−4.91 ppm) due to its coupling with
the C3 proton. The coupling constants (J) of the doublet peaks
of the C2 proton of all the compounds (3a−r) were calculated
from their respective 1H NMR spectra and found to be in the
range of 6.6−8.2 Hz (except the compound 3q having a
thiophene moiety at the C3-position, C2H, doublet, J = 6.3
Hz).17a Accordingly, the stereochemistry of the compounds
3a−r were assigned as cis on the basis of the X-ray structure
the compounds 3b and 3e coupled with the
analyses of
similarity in the NMR spectral pattern of the compounds 3a−r.

Successively, we investigated the Pd-catalyzed C−H arylation

the other working
auxiliaries for selectively arylating the C(3)−H bond of THF

substrates 1c−f, 1dA, 1eA, and 1fA with 2a (Figure 2), and
in these reactions we did not get any of the corresponding C−
H arylated THF products. These reactions indicated that 8-
aminoquinoline (Daugulis’s auxiliary14a,b) is an eﬀective
auxiliary, as the substrate 1a underwent the Pd-catalyzed C−

Furthermore, we focused our attention to further extend the
generality of this protocol, and we decided to investigate the
Pd-catalyzed direct C−H arylation of the methylene C(sp3)−H

initially, we assembled the substrate 1g by linking the

Daugulis’s bidentate directing group (8-aminoquinoline). Then
we performed the reaction of the substrate 1g with phenyl

In a representative case, the C−H arylated product 4p was
recrystallized and subjected to single-crystal X-ray structure
analysis. The X-ray structure of the representative compound
4p (see SI for the X-ray structure of 4p16) clearly conﬁrmed
that the C−H arylation of the substrate 1g was highly regio-
and stereoselective and the direct C−H arylation occurred only
at the C3-position of the substrate 1g and selectively gave the
2,3-disubstituted 1,4-benzodioxanes 4a−q with cis stereo-
chemistry (C2 and C3 stereocenters). Characteristically, the
C2 and C3 protons in compounds 4a−q appeared as doublets,
and the coupling constants (J) of the doublet peaks of C2 and
C3 protons of compounds 4a−q were calculated from their
respective 1H NMR spectra and found to be in the range of
2.8−3.1 Hz.18 Accordingly,
the stereochemistry of 2,3-

In summary, we have shown the bidentate directing group-
aided, Pd-catalyzed, highly regio- and stereoselective sp3 C−H
activation and direct arylation of the C(3)−H position of
tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-benzodioxane systems. The direct C−
H arylation occurred only at
the C3 position of racemic
tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxamides and gave the corresponding
racemic C3-arylated THF derivatives with excellent regio- and
diastereoselectivities. Similarly, the C−H arylation of chiral (R)-
or (S)-tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxamides resulted in the corre-
sponding chiral (2R,3R) and (2S,3S) C3-arylated-THF
scaﬀolds having cis stereochemistry with excellent regio- and
diastereoselectivities and very good ee. Overall, this protocol
has led to the production of a wide range of cis 2,3-
disubstituted THF−norlignan and benzodioxane−neolignan
scaﬀolds with very high regio- and stereoselectivities.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General. Melting points are uncorrected. FT-IR spectra of
compounds were recorded as thin ﬁlms or KBr pellets. 1H and 13C
NMR spectra of all compounds were recorded on 400 and 100 MHz
spectrometers, respectively (using TMS as an internal standard).
HRMS measurements reported in this work were obtained from a
TOF mass analyzer using electrospray ionization (ESI). Column
chromatography was carried out using silica gel 100−200 mesh. HPLC
analyses were performed using OD-H (0.46 cm IDR, 25 cm length) as
a chiral column (eluents, ﬂow rate, detection method are listed in the
HPLC charts). Reactions were performed in anhydrous solvent under
a nitrogen atmosphere. Solutions were dried using anhydrous Na2SO4.
Thin layer chromatography analyses were performed on silica gel
plates, and components were visualized by observation under iodine.
Isolated yields of all the compounds are reported and yields were not
optimized. In all the reactions, puriﬁcation of the crude reaction
mixture by the column chromatography gave only the major
diastereomer (as single compound) in pure form, and we did not
isolate any other compound in considerable quantity suitable for
characterization.

1bA−bC, 1dA, 1eA, and 1fA. The corresponding carboxylic acid
(1.5 mmol) was dissolved in SOCl2 (4 mmol) and stirred for 24 h at rt

and Et3N (1.1 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (2 mL) under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 10 min, and
then the reaction mixture was reﬂuxed for 12 h under a nitrogen
atmosphere. After this period, the reaction mixture was diluted with
DCM (5 mL) and washed with water followed by saturated aqueous
NaHCO3 solution. The combined organic layers were dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuum, and puriﬁcation of
the resulting reaction mixture by column chromatography (EtOAc/
hexanes = 30:70) furnished the corresponding cyclic ether
carboxamides 1a−i, 1bA−bC, 1dA, 1eA, and 1fA.
General Procedure for the Pd-Catalyzed C−H Arylation of
the Carboxamides 1a−i, 1bA−bC, 1dA, 1eA, and 1fA and
Preparation of 3a−r, 4a−q, 5a−h, and 6a−h. A mixture of the
corresponding cyclic ether carboxamide 1 (0.25 mmol, 1 equiv),
Pd(OAc)2 (5.6 mg, 10 mol %), ArI (1.0 mmol, 4 equiv), and AgOAc
(91.8 mg, 0.55 mmol, 2.2 equiv) in anhydrous toluene (3 mL) was
heated at 110 °C for 24−48 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the
reaction period, the reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuum, and
puriﬁcation of the resulting reaction mixture by silica gel column
chromatography furnished the corresponding C−H arylated cyclic
ether carboxamides 3a−r, 4a−q, 5a−h, and 6a−h (see tables/schemes
for speciﬁc examples).

Procedure for the Hydrolysis of the Amides 3b and 4a. To a
RB ﬂask (capacity 25 mL) ﬁtted with a Liebig condenser (length = 15
cm) sealed at the top and having a J Young air inlet valve at the side of
the RB ﬂask was sequentially added the corresponding carboxamide 3b
or 4a (0.25 mmol) dissolved in a mixture of toluene (3 mL) and water
(0.5 mL) and CF3SO3H (0.5 mL) using syringes. The air inlet was
closed, the reaction mixture was heated at 100 °C, and chilled water
was circulated in the outer glass tube of the condenser. After 12 h, the
reaction mixture was transferred from the RB ﬂask into a separating
funnel using a syringe, diluted with EtOAc, and extracted with
saturated aqueous Na2CO3 solution (20 mL × 2). Then the combined
aqueous layers were acidiﬁed with 1 N HCl (15 mL × 2) to get pH ∼
2. Then the aqueous layers were extracted using EtOAc (10 mL × 2),
the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and
evaporation in vacuum gave the corresponding carboxylic acid 7 or 8.

(16) Crystallographic data of the X-ray structures of 3b (CCDC
1041214), 3e (CCDC 1029716), 4p (CCDC 1029717), and 7

paper, the coupling constant (J) of the doublet peak of the OC(2)−H
moiety present
in trans-3-aryltetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylates was
reported to be in the range of 5.8−6.4 Hz not exceeding 6.4 Hz.
Further, the coupling constant (J) of the doublet peak of the OC(2)−
H moiety present
in cis-3-aryltetrahydrofuran-2-carboxylates was
reported to be in the range of 7.3−7.6 Hz. Analogously, in addition
to the unambiguous assignment of the stereochemistry of 3-aryl/
heteroaryl tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxamides 3a−r based on the X-ray
structures of 3b and 3e, the coupling constants (J) of the doublet peak
of the C2 proton of compounds 3a−r were found to be in the range of
6.6−8.2 Hz (except the compound 3q having a thiophene moiety at
the C3-position, C2H, doublet, J = 6.3 Hz). (b) Nozaki, H.; Takaya,

(18) (a) The coupling constant (J) of the doublet peak of the OC−
H moiety present in the 2,3-disubstituted benzodioxane system having
cis or trans stereochemistry has been reported to be 2.51 and 7−11
Hz,
respectively, see: Quaglia, W.; Pigini, M.; Giannella, M.;
Melchiorre, C. J. Med. Chem. 1990, 33, 2946 and references cited
