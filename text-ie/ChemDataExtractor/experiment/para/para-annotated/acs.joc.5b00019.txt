ABSTRACT: A copper-catalyzed direct ring-opening double N-arylation of benzoxazoles with aryl iodides has been developed.
The present system exhibits high selectivity despite competition from C-arylation. The selectivity between ring-opening N-
arylation and C-arylation was controlled by the choice of reaction vessel. The nitrile bound bis(triphenylphosphine)copper
cyanide was identiﬁed as the active catalytic species for both reactions, and when combined with a nitrile-containing solvent,
enhanced the reaction eﬃciency.

B enzoxazole derivatives are important heterocyclic organic

molecules in pharmaceutical research.1 Various function-
alizations of benzoxazole have been studied. In particular, the
most acidic C−H bond, between the nitrogen and oxygen
atom, can be easily activated allowing for the functionalization
of the C-2 position. Arylation of the C-2 position has been
explored using aryl halides in combination with palladium,
nickel, or copper catalysts.2−4 A stoichiometric amount of
copper iodide was employed to functionalize the C−H bond in
the C-2 position using an arylation reaction by Miura et al.4a
On the other hand, the Daugulis group developed a copper-
catalyzed arylation of the benzoxazole C-2 position with lithium
tert-butoxide as the base.4b In addition to carbon−carbon bond
the C-2 position, carbon−nitrogen bond
formation at
formation was also developed using transition metal-catalyzed
conditions.5

Direct arylation of the C-2 position can be in competition
with a ring-opening arylation reaction. In Miura’s system, a
small amount of triphenylamine derivative was detected which
could be synthesized via a benzoxazole ring-opening reaction
followed by N-arylation.4a Both the Ullmann and Buchwald-
Hartwig aminations are well-known copper-catalyzed cross-
coupling reactions between an aryl halide and an amine.6 These
reactions suggested that the benzoxazole was transformed into
an aminophenol derivative ﬁrst,
followed by a Buchwald-
Hartwig type N-arylation to form the triphenylamine product.
In a complementary fashion, Han et al. also applied the
benzoxazole ring-opening reaction to O-arylation reactions
using copper nanoparticles.7 In the proposed mechanism of this
system, cesium carbonate was ﬁrst employed to open the

benzoxazole ring, and then a copper-catalyzed O-arylation of
the ortho-aminophenol intermediate took place. Very little is
known about the ring-opening N-arylation as there are no
catalytic studies on this system to date, hence no way to
optimize the transformation. Described herein is our study on
the copper-catalyzed selective ring-opening N-arylation of
benzoxazole with aryl iodides.
<para sub=“opt”>
Using benzoxazole (1a) and iodobenzene (2a) as starting
materials, optimization of the ring-opening N-arylation was
undertaken (Table 1). While the C-2 arylated product (4aa)
was the major product using Miura’s condition,4a changing the
reaction vessel from a round-bottomed ﬂask to a screw-capped
reaction vial shifts the preference from an arylation of the C-2
position to a ring-opening N-arylation. Additionally, changing
the copper salt from copper(I) iodide to copper(I) cyanide
increased catalytic eﬃciency of the ring-opening N-arylation
(entry 2). It turns out that the counteranion in the copper
catalyst and the solvent displayed signiﬁcant eﬀects on the
catalytic activity as demonstrated in entry 3. Among the various
polar solvents screened,
the nitrile-containing solvents dis-
played improved reactivity and solubility. To circumvent the
low boiling point of many nitrile containing solvents,
pivalonitrile (2,2,-dimethylpropanenitrile, bp 105 °C) was
used for the ring-opening N-arylation reaction. While the
combination of both a nitrile-containing copper salt and solvent
has good reactivity, modulating the base had a pronounced
eﬀect. Using cesium carbonate as a base accelerated the ring-

aReaction condition: A mixture of benzoxazole (0.15 mmol), iodobenzene (0.45 mmol), copper salt, triphenylphosphine, and base (0.45 mmol) in
solvent (0.5 mL) was placed in a screw-capped vial, closed, and stirred for the indicated time and temperature. bIsolated yield of product reported as
an average from at least two independent measurements. cA mixture of benzoxazole (0.6 mmol), iodobenzene (1.8 mmol), copper salt (10 mol %),
triphenylphosphine (10 mol %), and cesium carbonate (1.8 mmol) in pivalonitrile (2 mL) was placed in round-bottomed ﬂask and stirred for 24 h.

opening N-arylation to aﬀord 2-(diphenylamino)phenol (3aa)
in 98% isolated yield (entry 4). It has been suggested that the
cesium carbonate plays a key role in the ring-opening of
benzoxazole. Han and co-workers proposed a cesium
carbonate-mediated benzoxazole ring-opening route for the
ﬁrst step of their reaction mechanism.7 In fact, switching to
cesium carbonate,
from sodium carbonate, decreased the
amount of copper salt required to obtain a similar yield
(entry 5) from stoichiometric (1 equiv) to catalytic (10 mol %)
amounts. However,
the reaction time and quantity of
phosphine ligand were inversely proportional. When the
reaction time decreased from 24 to 18 h, the amount of
phosphine required increased from 20 mol % to 30 mol %
(entry 6). Entries 5−7 demonstrate that
the amount of
triphenylphosphine ligand has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on this
particular system. Interestingly, the mono-N-arylation product
was not obtained as the major product under any condition,
even with only a single equivalent of aryl iodide present.

<para sub=“opt”>
Since CuCl(PPh3)3 is a widely studied and common copper
salt, the active catalytic species was expected to be CuCN-
(PPh3)3
in our optimized reaction condition. However,
bis(triphenylphosphine)copper cyanide was only obtained
and conﬁrmed by the reaction of copper cyanide and
triphenylphosphines.8 A hexameric PPh3-bounded copper

cyanide species [CuCN(PPh3)2]6 (5) could be synthesized
and isolated by following a previous report8a (Scheme 2). It was
originally reported as a red crystal; however, only colorless
crystals were obtained and the structure was conﬁrmed by
single crystal X-ray diﬀraction (Scheme 2 and Supporting
Information for detail). In the hexameric complex (5), the
nitrile coordinates with two copper atoms by using each carbon
and nitrogen atom. A decade ago, the polymeric structure of
CuCN was intensively studied, and it has a similar oligomeric
binding mode to CuCN(PPh3)2.9 Interestingly, the reaction
yield was improved by exchanging copper cyanide with the
synthesized bis(triphenylphosphine)copper cyanide salt and
reacting with external triphenylphosphines (entries 5, 7, and 8).
The best condition for the ring-opening double N-arylation was
achieved by using bis(triphenylphosphine)copper cyanide (5)
salt with additional triphenylphosphine ligands (entry 9).

Finally, perfect selectivity of arylation was revealed by the
simple choice of reaction vessel. In the optimized condition
(entry 9 in Table 1), the reaction was performed in a screw-
capped vial, and formed the ring-opened double-arylated
product 3aa, as the sole product. However, by changing the
reaction vessel from a closed, and assuming pressured, screw-
capped vial to an open round-bottomed ﬂask, the C-arylated
product 4aa was the major product and isolated in high yields

not achieved using DMF as the solvent. Both 3aa (59%) and
4aa (16%) were obtained from condition B in DMF at 150 °C.

To obtain any mechanistic insight into the present ring-
opening double N-arylation, the reaction was performed in
separated systems (Scheme 4). As discussed in ref 7,
benzoxazole rings can be opened by cesium carbonate. By
employing benzoxazole and cesium carbonate only, the ring-
opened 2-aminophenol was obtained in 23% yield, with the
remaining materials being unreacted benzoxazole. Interestingly,
a mixture of copper
triphenylphosphine, and base
converted benzoxazole to 2-aminophenol with higher yield
(62%), indicating that the copper catalyst can also aﬀect the
ring-opening of benzoxazole. Using 2-aminophenol as the
starting material for condition B, the ﬁnal product was obtained
in a 95% yield. Unsurprisingly, when the C-2 arylated product
(4aa) was used as a starting material, no further reaction (ring-
opening or arylation) was observed. These separate results led
us to propose that the copper-catalyzed ring-opening double N-
arylation is a sequential set of reactions. Ring-opening of
benzoxazole occurs ﬁrst, followed by the copper-catalyzed N-
arylation to form the product.10
</para>
In summary, we have presented a copper-catalyzed direct
arylation and ring-opening double N-arylation of benzoxazoles.
A judicious choice of both the copper catalyst and reaction
conditions was crucial for achieving selectivity and preference
for the catalytic activity to follow a nontraditional route. The
reaction pathway between C-arylation and ring-opening double
N-arylation was perfectly controlled by the choice of reaction
vessel with a nitrile-containing solvent. A wide range of
substituted starting materials was examined using the developed
copper-catalyzed arylation of benzoxazoles. In this system, the
key parameters, such as the substituent placement on either the
aryl halide or the benzoxazole, and the electronics of the
leading to an improved
substituent, can be teased apart
