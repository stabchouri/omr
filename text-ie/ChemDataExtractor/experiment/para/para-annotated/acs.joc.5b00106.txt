ABSTRACT: The synthesis of dihydrobenzofuran-appended
oxindoles has been accomplished taking advantage of an
unprecedented reaction between allenols and phenols under
metal catalysis.

T he dihydrobenzofuran motif is present in a wide variety of

natural products and biologically relevant compounds,1
and the synthesis of this heterocycle is of current interest.2
Numerous reports are available on metal-catalyzed cyclization
functionalized allenes.3 In
or cross-coupling reactions of
contrast, such reactions that involve the coupling of the allene
moiety and a phenol are scarcely accessible in literature.4
Despite the fact that phenols are readily available chemicals,
their use is problematic due to selectivity issues. Recently, we
have successfully reported selective transformations of both
indolinone-tethered allenols5 and phenols.6 We envisioned that
a diﬀerent behavior of the allenol moiety might be achieved
utilizing a phenol as a coupling partner. Herein, we present a
gallium-catalyzed coupling−cyclization between phenols and
toward the preparation of
indolinone-tethered allenols
dihydrobenzofuran-linked oxindoles.
<para sub=“opt”>
To explore the possibility of an allene−phenol coupling,
allenol 1a and phenol 2a were initially chosen. The AuCl3-
catalyzed reaction of allenol 1a and 4-methylphenol 2a aﬀorded
the spirocyclic 2,5-dihydrofuran 3a (Scheme 1). Hence, the
hydroxy group in allenol 1a exclusively suﬀers a 5-endo
oxycyclization reaction,7 without the participation of the phenol
moiety.
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
When a π acid such as AuCl3 is used, it might coordinate
with one of the allene double bonds via a monodentade mode.
When a Lewis acid is employed, it might coordinate with the
OH of the allenol moiety via mono- or bidentate modes. This
activation might generate a carbocation intermediate. Con-
sequently, we decided to use a main-group salt instead of a
transition-metal derivative. Happily, after assessing various
metal catalysts, we found that a catalytic amount of metal
triﬂate speciﬁcally promoted the domino allenol−phenol
coupling reaction (Table 1). The domino reaction took place

at 40 °C under M(OTf)n catalysis, which speciﬁcally promoted
the generation of
the desired dihydrobenzofuran-appended
oxindole scaﬀold, and the domino addition−cyclization
reaction took place readily.8 Diastereoselectivities were modest,
in all cases giving rise to mixtures of adducts 4a and 5a. Based
on conversion and isolated yields, gallium(III) triﬂate proved to
be the most eﬃcient Lewis acid catalyst (Table 1, entry 12).9,10
An experiment using molecular sieves as an additive led to
comparable results, thus indicating that this transformation
could be eﬃciently catalyzed by metal triﬂates. A screening of
solvents (acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran, toluene) revealed that
the reaction is best performed in dichloromethane. A Brønsted
acid such as triﬂuoromethanesulfonic acid (TfOH) was also
tested. The corresponding rearranged α,β-unsaturated ketone
was the major reaction product under stoichiometric TfOH
conditions. However, the use of 10 mol % TfOH aﬀorded
adducts 4a and 5a along with a minor rearranged ketone, but
did not promote the reaction to completion, with some
unreacted starting material remaining. Comparatively, the use
of TfOH led to limited reactivity.

the phenol reactant was ﬁrst examined by submitting 4-
methoxyphenol 1d to various allenols 1. In the event, phenol 1e
reacted well and the corresponding adducts 4d, 4l, 5d, and 5l
were obtained. Unfortunately, a negative result was observed
using either 4-hydroxybenzonitrile or methyl 4-hydroxy-
benzoate, which indicated that electron-withdrawing groups
on the aromatic ring were not compatible with this catalytic
arylation/oxycyclization reaction sequence. The Rf values of the
two dihydrobenzofuran isomers 4a−l and 5a−l were very close
to each other. Fortunately, the diastereomeric adducts 4 and 5
could be separated by ﬂash chromatography,
thus readily
providing two structurally complex and valuable heterocyclic
products. However, characterization of minor adducts 5c, 5d,
5f−i, 5k, and 5l was performed on a mixture containing small
amounts of their major counterparts 4. Because most of the
reactions were conducted in a 50 mg scale, it was desirable to
scale-up the procedure. Worthy of note, when we performed a
4 mmol-scale reaction starting from allenol 1a and phenol 2a,
adducts 4a and 5a were isolated in a combined yield of 59%,
which is slightly higher than that achieved at a smaller scale
during the scope study. The structure of dihydrobenzofuran 5a
was unambiguously conﬁrmed with the help of an X-ray
diﬀraction analysis on suitable crystals of
this compound

Next, the reaction of aryl-substituted allenol derivatives and
phenols was examined. To test the reactivity of aryl allenes 6,
we started the initial
investigation on the gallium-catalyzed
reaction of phenyl-substituted allene 6a under otherwise
identical reaction conditions used for its methyl-counterpart
1a. In the event, it was found that substrate 6a was exclusively
transformed into the rearranged product 7a (Scheme 3).13

With the optimized reaction conditions in hand we then
examined the scope and generality of the Ga-catalyzed method.
Thus, various methyl-substituted allenols and phenols were
reacted to give a range of dihydrobenzofuran-appended
oxindoles 4 and 5 (Scheme 2).11 The two products obtained
from the coupling reaction are not identical but rather stand in
an epimeric relationship at the allylic position. Although the
diastereoselectivity of the reaction between 1a and 2a is poor
under the conditions (Table 1), eﬀorts for further improve-
ments were not in vain. Interestingly, the use of both NH-free
allenols 1b−d and phenols bearing bulkier substituents (such as
Br or t-Bu) resulted in improved diastereoselectivities (Scheme
2). The inﬂuence of the electronic nature of the substituents at

Scheme 4. Mechanistic Explanation for the Ga(III)-Catalyzed Synthesis of Dihydrobenzofurans 4 and 5 from Allenols 1 and
Phenols
<para sub=“opt”>
Noticeably, despite the above-mentioned ability (Schemes 1
and 2) of metal triﬂate based catalysis for the coupling reaction
of allenols 1 and phenols into dihydrobenzofurans 4/5, no
traces of oxacycles were detected using gallium(III) triﬂate as a
promoter. Possibly, attempts to use aryl-substituted substrates 6
proved to be unsuccessful

<para sub=“ques”>
A possible pathway for the gallium-catalyzed generation of
dihydrobenzofuran-linked oxindoles 4 and 5 is outlined in
Scheme 4. Initially, Ga(OTf)3 acts as a Lewis acid interacting
with the allene and phenol moieties simultaneously via a
bidentade mode. The formation of a complex 1-Ga through
both π-coordination of the metal to the allene group of allenols
1 and σ-coordination to the hydroxy group of phenols 2 may be
involved. Subsequent nucleophilic addition of
the phenol
moiety at the sterically less hindered carbon center in complex
1-Ga would lead to a ketone intermediate, which after
tautomerization aﬀorded the more stable enol-form 8. Then,
from zwitterionic
an elimination of water and Ga(OTf)3
intermediate 8 occurs to generate gallium species 9 through η-
coordination of the gallium salt to the more substituted double
bond. Species 9 suﬀers an intramolecular chemo- and
regioselective 5-exo-trig oxycyclization reaction to produce
zwitterionic dihydrobenzofurans 10. This nucleophilic attack
from the O-phenol site occurs as a result of the stability of the
intermediate oxonium type cation 10. Loss of HOTf
in
zwitterionic dihydrobenzofurans 10 generates neutral metal
species 11. Finally, protonolysis of the carbon−gallium bond of
11 liberates dihydrobenzofurans 4 and 5 with concomitant
regeneration of the Ga(III) catalytic species (Scheme 4).
</para>
In conclusion,

the synthesis of dihydrobenzofuran-linked
oxindoles has been accomplished taking advantage of an
unprecedented reaction between allenols and phenols under
Lewis acid catalysis. Probably, Ga(OTf)3 merges allene and
phenol moieties simultaneously via a bidentate mode.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Methods. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on 700
or 300 MHz spectrometers: 1H NMR (300 or 700 MHz) and 13C
NMR (75 or 175 MHz). NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or
C6D6 solutions, except if otherwise stated. Chemical shifts are given in
ppm relative to TMS (1H, 0.0 ppm), or CDCl3 (13C, 76.9 ppm), or
C6D6 (13C, 128.4 ppm). Low and high resolution mass spectra were
acquired on a QTOF LC/MS spectrometer using the electronic
impact (EI) or electrospray (ES) mode.

Typical Procedure for the Ga(OTf)3-Catalyzed Coupling
Reaction of α-Allenols 1 and Phenols 2. General Procedure
for the Preparation of Dihydrobenzofuran-Appended Oxin-
doles 4 and 5. To a solution of the appropriate allenol 1 (0.46
mmol) in dichloromethane (5 mL) at room temperature, Ga(OTf)3
(0.046 mmol) was added under an argon atmosphere and stirring was
continued for 5 min. Then, the corresponding phenol 2 (1.28 mmol)
was added and stirring was continued for another 5 min. Then, the
reaction mixture was stirred at reﬂux temperature until the starting
material disappeared as indicated by TLC. After ﬁltration through a
pad of Celite, the mixture was concentrated under vacuum and
puriﬁed by ﬂash column chromatography, eluting with ethyl acetate/
hexanes or dichloromethane/ethyl acetate mixtures. Spectroscopic and
analytical data for pure forms of compounds 4 and 5 follow.
