ABSTRACT: 2-Bromo-3-methoxycyclohex-2-en-1-ones are readily
alkylated at C-6 with reactive halides, and then treatment with
DBU (2 equiv) in PhMe at room temperature results in smooth
loss of bromide and aromatization to resorcinol monomethyl ethers
of deﬁned substitution pattern.

■ INTRODUCTION
<para sub="scope">
During synthetic work related to coleophomone B1 we
alkylated the bromide 1 with prenyl bromide (1 → 2, Scheme
1) under standard conditions (LDA, THF, −78 °C) and then
tried to carry out a second alkylation at C-6 with a diﬀerent
allylic halide (2 → 3), again using LDA at a low temperature.
However, we found that very little alkylation occurred unless
the temperature was raised to 0 °C, at which point we did
obtain a somewhat larger proportion of the desired product (3)
as a mixture of diastereoisomers, together with a small amount
of the monomethyl ether 4.

The transformation 2 → 4 represents a regiocontrolled

<para sub="scope">
There are several corresponding methods described in the
literature. The use of DDQ in reﬂuxing dioxane for
dehydrogenation of 3-alkoxycyclohex-2-en-1-ones appears to
give poor yields (29−38%)3 and sometimes fails altogether.4
Likewise, dehydrogenation with Pd-black in reﬂuxing cymene is
also not reliable,4 but use of Hg(OAc)2 in reﬂuxing acetic acid
did work well (e.g., 84% yield) in a case where experiments
with DDQ and Pd-black were unsuccessful.4,5 Treatment of the
silyl ether 5 with I2 in reﬂuxing MeOH gave the silyl ether 6 in
84% yield (Scheme 2).6 In principle, one would expect
desilylation of 6 to be easy, so this method should also provide
a route to resorcinol monomethyl ethers.

<para sub=“opt”>
In attempting to improve the second alkylation step (2 → 3),
we tried to generate the required enolate with (Me3Si)2NK in
THF at −78 °C, and after an arbitrary period of 30 min, we
quenched the mixture with very dilute hydrochloric acid,
hoping to establishthrough recovery of 2that the desired
enolate was stable at a low temperature. However, very little of
2 was recovered and 4 was the major isolable product.

Further experiments showed that the trans isomer of 2
(trans-2), whose structure was veriﬁed by single crystal X-ray
analysis, could be alkylated (trans-2 → 3) in 28% yield (71%
corrected for recovered 2, which was now a 10:1 cis−trans
mixture). In contrast, cis-2 could not be alkylated to any

In certain highly speciﬁc cases, in the presence of Rh3+, a

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub="scope">
The present method is experimentally straightforward: One
alkylates a 2-bromo-3-methoxycyclohex-2-en-1-one (e.g., 1 →
2) and adds 2 equiv of DBU to a room temperature solution of
the alkylation product in PhMe. Using as a test case compound
18 (see Table 1),
the only one whose aromatization we
monitored, we found that the reaction is over within 5 h at 50
°C, but it is more convenient to carry out the aromatizations at
room temperature for an overnight period. The reactions are all
very clean, and Table 1 lists our results.

The starting 2-bromo-3-methoxycyclohex-2-en-1-one (1) is
easily prepared by bromination12 (NBS, 91% yield) of 3-
methoxy-5-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-one,
itself available by the
classical procedure of Michael addition of ethyl acetoacetate to
methyl crotonate in the presence of EtONa (54%), followed by
heating with acid at pH 113 and O-methylation with
(MeO)3CH (91%).14 This synthetic route is general,15 and
compound 27 was made analogously from methyl (E)-pent-2-
enoate.16

The alkylation step to attach the C-6 chain (LDA, alkyl
halide, THF, −78 °C) gave the yields indicated in Table 1. All
the alkylations were done with an alkyl bromide, except for the
preparation of 18, where methyl iodide was used.

Allylic, propargylic, and benzylic bromides are suitable
alkylating agents, and we have also used an α-bromo ester

the alkylation step were unsuccessful, but all the activated
bromides we used and methyl
iodide worked satisfactorily,
giving yields of at

Table 1) were inconsequential mixtures of chromatographically

the NMR spectra represented the minor isomer or an impurity.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Procedures. Solvents used for chromatography were
distilled before use. Commercial thin-layer chromatography plates
(silica gel, Merck 60F-254) were used. Silica gel
for ﬂash
chromatography was Merck type 60 (230−400 mesh). Dry solvents
were prepared under an inert atmosphere and transferred by syringe or
cannula. The symbols s, d, t, and q used for 13C NMR spectra indicate
zero, one,
the
assignments being made from APT spectra. Solutions were evaporated
under water pump vacuum, and the residue was then kept under oil
pump vacuum. High-resolution electrospray mass spectrometric
analyses were done with an orthogonal time-of-ﬂight analyzer, and
electron ionization mass spectra were measured with a double-focusing
sector mass spectrometer.

then recooled to −78 °C and a solution of prenyl bromide (2.24 mL,

left in place, but not recharged, and stirring was continued for 6 h. The

extracted with EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were washed

extracted thoroughly with EtOAc. The combined organic extracts were
washed with brine, dried (MgSO4), and evaporated. The residue was
dissolved in MeOH (5 mL) and (MeO)3CH (0.72 mL, 700 mg, 6.61

× 15 cm), using 1:1 EtOAc−hexanes, gave 33 (363 mg, 76% over two
steps) as a colorless oil: FTIR (CDCl3, cast) 3395, 1612 cm−1; 1H
NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ 1.44 (br s, 1 H), 1.67 (s, 3 H), 3.80 (s, 3

1-({[(2E)-4-Bromo-3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl]oxy}methyl)-4-me-
thoxybenzene (34).23 Ph3P (227 mg, 0.866 mmol) and CBr4 (240
mg, 0.723 mmol) were added to a stirred and cooled (0 °C) solution
of 33 (160 mg, 0.723 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (7 mL). Stirring was
continued for 3.5 h and the solvent was then evaporated. Flash
chromatography of the residue over silica gel (1.8 × 15 cm), using
1:12 EtOAc−hexanes, gave 34 (187 mg, 91%) as a colorless oil: FTIR
(CDCl3, cast) 1612 cm−1; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 500 MHz) δ 1.78 (s, 3
H), 3.80 (s, 3 H), 3.96 (s, 2 H), 4.02 (d, J = 6.5 Hz, 2 H), 4.44 (s, 2
H), 5.78−5.80 (m, 1 H), 6.88 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 2 H), 7.26 (d, J = 7.5 Hz,
