ABSTRACT: A tin-free trans-Diels−Alder paradigm for the stereoselective
synthesis of
trans-fused polycyclic systems was developed through the
photocatalytic reductive dehalogenation of α-haloketones promoted by visible
light. Good to excellent diastereoselectivities were observed in the
stereoselective construction of trans-fused octalone derivatives under mild
reaction conditions.

S tereoselective construction of trans-fused bicyclic systems is

an important task in organic synthesis, because they are
among the most versatile intermediates for the synthesis of
various polycyclic natural products and relevant compounds.
Danishefsky and co-workers developed a two-step trans-Diels−
Alder (DA) protocol, which provides expeditious access to
trans-fused octalins and hydrindanes from nitroalkene dien-
ophiles and simple dienes.1 This conceptually novel strategy
involves equipping cyclohexenes with a nitro group as a
traceless activating group, thereby enhancing the dienophilicity
of the otherwise unreactive dienophiles to yield cis-fused DA
adducts. Subsequent free radical-mediated reduction of this
angular functionality using AIBN and nBu3SnH furnishes the
target
trans-fused bicyclic systems with good to excellent
selectivity.1 The research groups of Danishefsky and Yamamoto
have independently reported that the Lewis acid catalyzed DA
reactions of α-halogentated 2-cycloalkenones with 1,3-buta-
dienes can provide eﬃcient access to cis-fused bicyclic systems
with a halogenated quaternary stereogenic center.2 The
halogenated cis-fused cycloadducts were then successfully
converted to the trans-fused octalones in a highly stereo-
selective fashion by tin-mediated free radical reduction and
reductive alkylation.2b,3,4 In contrast with traditional reductive
dehalogenation reactions, which are nonstrategic from the
standpoint of redox economy,5 the dehalogenation step in the
trans-DA paradigm can be considered strategic, since the
reduction of carbon−halogen bond would be compensated by
the concomitant inversion of conﬁguration at the ring junction
stereogenic center.

the intrinsic toxicity of

Despite these advances,

there still exists a need for
developing new and green methods for the stereoselective
synthesis of trans-fused polycyclic systems, because organotin
hydride-mediated radical reactions have two major disadvan-
tages:
tin-based reagents and the
diﬃculty of removing their residues from the products. These
practical considerations have proved to be a serious hurdle to
industrial applications.
Inspired by the reports from the
laboratories of Stephenson, Zeitler and Reiser,6 we envisaged
that visible-light-induced photocatalytic dehalogenation might
be an ideal platform for the development of a green and

that

environmentally benign trans-DA protocol
is free of
organotin reagent. Visible-light-mediated photoredox catalysis
has recently emerged as a powerful tool for a range of organic
transformations owing to its inherent features of sustainability
and green chemistry as well as promising potential for use in
industry.7 Herein, we report a tin-free methodology using
visible-light-induced photoredox catalysis for the stereoselective
synthesis of trans-fused polycycles.8

We began our investigation by examining the photocatalytic
reductive dehalogenation of α-bromoketone 1a. By employing
the reaction conditions recently disclosed by Stephenson and
co-workers,6a a degassed solution of 1a in DMSO (0.05 M) was
irradiated by blue LEDs at
room temperature with Ru-
·6H2O (3) (2.0 mol %, bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) as a
(bpy)3Cl2
photocatalyst in the presence of formic acid (10 equiv) and
iPr2NEt (10 equiv). Under
the desired
product 2a was obtained in 31% yield with a 3:1 ratio of trans-
2a to cis-2a, as established by comparison with authentic
reference compounds (Table 1, entry 1).3 Fortunately a more
substantial
improvement in both the yield and diastereose-
lectivity was realized when we turned to the Hantzsch ester
(HEH) 4 as a hydrogen-atom donor. Accordingly, by ﬁxing 4 as
the hydrogen source, we carefully optimized other reaction
parameters such as bases, solvents, concentration and the
stoichiometry of the reagents and photocatalysts. As for the
bases, nBu3N proved to be superior over other organic and
inorganic bases, providing 2a as a 9:1 trans/cis mixture in 84%
yield (entry 5 vs entries 2−4). Intriguingly, the ratio of trans-2a
to cis-2a was further improved to 12:1, albeit with a slightly
diminished yield of 68%, when the reaction was carried out in
the absence of a base (entry 6). Although at this point it is
diﬃcult to know whether the superior result achieved in the
absence of an additional base is primarily due to a subtle
electronic eﬀect in the nature of the hydrogen atom transfer
event, this result apparently demonstrates that 4 can act as both

photoreductive process. Control experiments revealed that a
photocatalyst, 4 and visible light were essential for the eﬃcient
conversion of 1a into 2a (entries 7−10). Finally, we evaluated
several frequently employed photocatalysts in the debromina-
tion of 1a under otherwise identical conditions. While
Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 compared favorably with 3 in terms of yield
(entry 11 vs entry 5), Ru(phen)3Cl2 (phen = 1,10-phenanthro-
line) and Ir(ppy)3 (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine) proved to be less
eﬀective than 3 in terms of diastereoselectivity and yield,
respectively (entries 13 and 14). Notably, the highest yield of
2a was obtained when the reaction was catalyzed by
Ru(bpy)3(PF6)2 under base-free conditions (entry 12).
Considering its commercial availability and high reproducibility,
we decided to use 3 as the photocatalyst for further studies.

Having the optimized reaction conditions in hand, we next
explored the scope and limitations of
this photocatalytic
dehalogenation reaction with a range of known α-haloketone-
s2a,3 and newly synthesized α-bromoketones 1g−1h as well.
The latter were both prepared by the Lewis-acid catalyzed DA
reaction of 5 with appropriate dienes (Scheme 1). The results
of these studies are summarized in Table 2.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Initially, we sought to probe the eﬀect of the α-halogen
substituents on the diastereoselectivity, and a series of octalone
derivatives 1a−1c with three diﬀerent α-halogen substitutions
were evaluated under the optimized conditions (Table 2). The
use of α-iodoketone 1b resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in the
yield of 2a, while maintaining a similar diastereoselectivity. The
reaction could also be extended to α-chloroketones, but the use
of 2.0 equiv of 4 was necessary in order to achieve complete
conversion for these substrates. For example, subjecting 1c to
irradiation with blue LEDs in the presence of 4 (2.0 equiv)

cleanly aﬀorded 2a in a good yield of 86%, although a slightly
elevated temperature (40 °C) was necessary for improving
eﬃciency. Surprisingly, a remarkable erosion in the diaster-
eoselectivity (trans/cis = 3:1) was observed for 1c regardless of
the temperatures. Although a full understanding of decisive
factors that control the diastereoselectivity must await further
mechanistic studies, the dehalogenation step for 1c might be an
exothermic reaction (early transition state), whereas the similar
step for both 1a and 1b seems to be an endothermic reaction
(late transition state).9 As anticipated, the cis-fused product 2h
the α-
was predominant (trans/cis = 1:4) in the case of
chlorohydrindanoid 1k. Gratifyingly, we found that
the
reductive dehalogenation reaction can be easily carried out at
gram scale without
signiﬁcantly eroding either yield or
diastereoselectivity, as exempliﬁed with 1a.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
Importantly, we found that the steric bulk of a geminal
dimethyl pattern at the β-position relative to the carbonyl
group was compatible with a range of
substrates, and
profoundly aﬀected diastereoselectivity to favor
the trans-
bicyclic systems in all cases (Table 2), presumably because of a
bigger diﬀerence in free-energy between transoid and cisoid
conformers (see Scheme 2).10 For both of the unprecedented
trans-octalones (i.e., 2e and 2f),
the structures were
unambiguously determined by preparation of the correspond-
ing cis-fused products (i.e., 2e′ and 2f′) as reference samples by
the Lewis acid catalyzed DA reaction of 6 with isoprene (9) and
1,2-dimethylenecyclohexane (10), respectively (Scheme 1).11
In accord with Casadevall’s observation,12 the 13C NMR
chemical shifts of the two ring junction carbons of cis-2e′
appear at 47.7 and 30.7 ppm as singlets, whereas two singlets
are observed at 49.5 and 36.1 ppm in the 13C NMR spectrum of
trans-2e. The debromination of 1j exhibited complete
diastereoselectivity to aﬀord the trans-bicyclic 2g as a single
diastereomer.3,13

Several experiments were carried out in order to gain a better
understanding of the reaction mechanism. First, we resubmitted
a stereochemically pure sample of trans-2a to the photocatalytic

extended reaction time of 14 h, the trans-2a was recovered
unchanged and any traces of the corresponding cis-isomer were

Carefully monitoring the course of the debromination of 1a
indicated that the ratio of trans-2a to cis-2a is not changing and
remains constant. These experiments lead us to believe that (1)
the photocatalytic product 2a does not undergo a secondary
photochemical reaction, such as Norrish type I fragmentation
reaction under these conditions, and (2) the process involving
inversion of conﬁguration, namely the hydrogen abstraction
step, is irreversible and might be the rate-determining step of
the overall process; slow conversion of 1a and low yielding of

On the basis of these results and previous reports,6,14 we
propose a plausible mechanism in Scheme 2. Upon irradiation
with blue LEDs (∼450 nm), 3 will readily absorb a photon to
generate the excited state *[Ru(bpy)3]2+, which would be
reductively quenched by 4 to provide the strong reductant
[Ru(bpy)3]+ with concomitant
the nitrogen
radical cation 12. The crucial step of this mechanism is the
single-electron transfer (SET) from the electron-rich Ru(I)
species to the electron deﬁcient α-haloketone 1 to induce the
reductive scission of the C-X bond, rapidly furnishing the alkyl
radical species 14 via the radical anion 13 while returning the
[Ru(bpy)3]2+ 3 to the catalytic cycle. Subsequent irreversible
hydrogen atom transfer from the radical cation 12 to this
electron deﬁcient intermediate 14 would generate the trans-
fused bicyclic 2 and the pyridine byproduct 15. The selective
trans-2 could be explained by a preferential
formation of
formation of conformer 14a over conformer 14b (Scheme 2).

Since visible-light-induced reductive debrominaiton occurs

Finally, we examined removal of the sulfur auxiliary from 16 to
gain access to an angularly nonfunctionalized trans-IDA(s)

an excess of Raney Ni in acetone aﬀorded the desired 18 along

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Experimental Methods. Unless otherwise noted, all
reagents were purchased at the highest commercial quality from
commercial suppliers and used without further puriﬁcation. Dichloro-
methane and 1,2-dichloroethane were distilled over CaH2 under an
atmosphere of nitrogen just prior to use. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was distilled over CaH2 under a reduced pressure and stored over 3 Å
molecular sieves. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (Hünig base) and tri-n-
butylamine were dried over KOH overnight, distilled from zinc dust
and stored over 3 Å molecular sieves. All reactions were carried out in
ﬂame-dried glassware under an atmosphere of nitrogen unless
otherwise noted. Analytical TLC was performed on silica gel 60
F254 plates and visualized by UV ﬂuorescence quenching and KMnO4
staining. Flash column chromatography was performed on silica gel 60
(40−63 mm). Unless otherwise noted, products were isolated as a
mixture of diastereomers. Diastereomeric ratios were determined by
1H NMR. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 500
MHz spectrometer at ambient temperature unless otherwise stated.
Chemical shifts are reported in parts per million relative to residual
solvent CDCl3 (7.26 ppm for 1H and 77.0 ppm for 13C). The
multiplicities of 1H NMR are reported as follows: s = singlet, d =
doublet, dd = doublet of doublets, ddd = doublet of doublet of
doublets, dddd = doublet of doublet of doublet of doublets, t = triplet,
ddt = doublet of doublet of triplets, td = triplet of doublets, dq =
doublet of quartets, m = multiplet, br = broad. IR spectra were
recorded on a FT-IR spectrometer and are reported in terms of
frequency of absorption (cm−1). High-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) were performed on a TOF system for the electrospray
ionization (ESI) experiment. Melting points are reported uncorrected.
General Procedure for the Diels−Alder Reaction of Cyclo-
alkenones. To a solution of cycloalkenone (1.00 equiv) in anhydrous
CH2Cl2 or 1,2-dichloroethane (0.20 M) at an appropriate temperature
was added ethylaluminum dichloride (1.0 M solution in hexanes,
0.100−1.00 equiv) via syringe. The reaction mixture was stirred at the
same temperature for 10 min and then diene (4.00 or 10.0 equiv) was
added in one portion via syringe. The resultant mixture was stirred
until the reaction was complete as judged by TLC analysis. At this
point the reaction was quenched by a small amount of triethylamine
and a saturated solution of potassium sodium tartrate (Rochelle salt)
was added to the mixture. After being stirred vigorously for 5 min at
room temperature, the mixture was poured into water and extracted
with CH2Cl2 three times. The combined extract was washed with
water and brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, ﬁltered and
concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The crude mixture thus
obtained was puriﬁed by ﬂash column chromatography on silica gel to
aﬀord the desired cycloadduct.

General Procedure for the Dehalogenation of α-Haloke-
tones. A ﬂame-dried 15 mL Schlenk-type ﬂask ﬁtted with a magnetic
stir bar was charged with 1 (0.150 mmol, 1.00 equiv), 4 (57.0 mg,
0.225 mmol, 1.50 equiv) and 3 (2.2 mg, 3.0 μmol, 2.0 mol %). The
ﬂask was sealed with a rubber septum, evacuated and backﬁlled with
N2. To this mixture was added dry DMSO (3 mL, 0.05 M) followed by
tri-n-butylamine (41.7 mg, 0.225 mmol, 1.50 equiv). The resultant
mixture was degassed for 20 min by nitrogen purging and irradiated at
room temperature with blue LEDs (at a distance of approximately 10
cm so that the reaction mixture did not heat up during the course of
the reaction). After stirring for 8−11 h at room temperature, the
reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3
× 10 mL). The combined extract was washed with water and brine,
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, ﬁltered and concentrated using a rotary
evaporator. The crude mixture thus obtained was puriﬁed by ﬂash
column chromatography on silica gel to aﬀord the dehalogenated
product 2.

Procedure for the Dehalogenation of 1a at Gram Scale. A
ﬂame-dried 250 mL one-necked, round-bottomed ﬂask ﬁtted with a
magnetic stir bar was charged with 1a (1.03 g, 4.00 mmol, 1.00 equiv),
4 (1.52 g, 6.00 mmol, 1.50 equiv) and 3 (60.0 mg, 0.0800 mmol, 2.00
mol %). The ﬂask was sealed with a rubber septum, evacuated and
backﬁlled with N2 (three cycles). To this mixture was added dry
DMSO (80 mL, 0.05 M) followed by tri-n-butylamine (1.11 g, 6.00
mmol, 1.50 equiv). The resultant mixture was degassed for 30 min by
nitrogen purging and irradiated at room temperature with blue LEDs
(at a distance of approximately 10 cm so that the reaction mixture did
not heat up during the course of the reaction). After stirring for 13 h at
room temperature, the reaction mixture was diluted with water and
extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 25 mL). The combined extract was
washed with water and brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, ﬁltered
and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The crude mixture thus
obtained was puriﬁed by ﬂash column chromatography on silica gel to
aﬀord the desired product 2a (588 mg, 82%, trans/cis = 9:1) as an oﬀ-
white solid. A diastereomerically pure sample of trans-2a was isolated
as a white solid by column chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc = 15:1).

0.154 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in acetone (3.1 mL, 0.050 M) at room
temperature was treated with an excess of Raney Ni (washed with
acetone 5 times just prior to use). The resultant mixture was stirred
vigorously for 4.5 h. At this point the mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2
and ﬁltered on a pad of Celite. The ﬁltrate was dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4, ﬁltered and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The
crude mixture thus obtained was puriﬁed by ﬂash column
chromatography (hexanes/EtOAc = 19:1 → 17:1) on silica gel to
aﬀord a 22:1 diastereomeric mixture of 18 and 17 (20.3 mg, 80%) as a
