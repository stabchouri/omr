ABSTRACT: A copper-mediated formally dehydrative biaryl
coupling of azine N-oxides and oxazoles has been developed.
The C−C bond-forming process proceeds, accompanied by
the removal of the oxygen atom from the azine core, to directly
aﬀord the azine−oxazole biaryl linkage. Moreover, this system
requires no noble transition metals such as palladium and
rhodium, which are common promotors in the related
dehydrogenative couplings with the azine N-oxide. Thus, the present protocol can provide a unique and less expensive
approach to the azine-containing biheteroaryls of substantial interest in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry.

■ INTRODUCTION

Pyridines are representative six-membered N-heteroaromatics
and constitute an important class of compounds in organic
chemistry. Particularly, pyridine-containing heterobiaryls are
prevalent structural motifs in biologically active compounds and
natural products.1 The most reliable approach to the above
heteroaromatic cores is the transition-metal-catalyzed cross-
coupling reaction with (hetero)aryl halides and (hetero)-
arylmetals.2 However, recent advances in metal-promoted C−
H activation3 can obviate prefunctionalization steps, such as
halogenation or stoichiometric metalation, of starting (hetero)-
arenes and provide a useful complement to the conventional
cross-coupling technology. However, probably because of their
electron deﬁciency, the direct C−H arylation of pyridine and
related azine compounds still remains a challenge, except for
several cases.4 To overcome such a lower reactivity of the azines
toward direct arylation, an appropriate activating substituent,
namely, an oxygen atom5 or an acylated imino group,6 is
introduced to the nitrogen atom on the azine ring. In particular,
the oxygen-based activation strategy has made great progress
and now allows the otherwise reluctant azine core to be
adopted in the metal-catalyzed C−H arylation with aryl halides
or organometallic reagents (Scheme 1a)5c−g and even more
challenging C−H/C−H coupling with simple arenes or
heteroarenes (Scheme 1b).7 Although the latter process is
especially appealing because both starting materials are
nonhalogenated and nonmetalated and azine-heteroarene
conjugations of biological importance are readily accessible,7b−i
an additional deoxygenation step is inevitable for obtaining the
desired azine-containing heterobiaryls.

Meanwhile, our group8 and others9 recently focused on the
unique reactivity of less expensive and abundant copper salts in
C−H functionalization and developed some noble-metal-free,
copper-mediated C−H/C−H biaryl couplings. During our
continuous interest in this research ﬁeld, we next tested the
azine N-oxide as a coupling partner10 for oxazoles in copper-

from the above precedents,

promoted dehydrogenative biaryl coupling. The C−C bond
forming reaction proceeded, however, with concomitant
unexpected removal of the oxygen from the azine aromatic
core to directly furnish the azine−oxazole π-conjugation
(Scheme 1c). Diﬀerent
the
copper-based system required no individual reduction step for
the removal of the oxygen from the coupling products. Similar
deoxygenative C2-arylations of azine N-oxides are reported, but
they employ prefunctionalized, reactive aryl nucleophiles such
as Grignard reagents5f or arylboronates5g (Scheme 1a). In this
work, we report
the copper-mediated formally
dehydrative biaryl coupling of azine N-oxides and oxazoles.
The present dehydrative coupling11 occurs even under noble-
metal-free conditions and thus provides a unique and
potentially eﬀective access to pyridine- and relevant azine-
containing biheteroaryls of substantial interest in pharmaceut-
ical and medicinal chemistry (Scheme 2). A related dehydrative
coupling of azine N-oxides with alkenes under Pd catalysis was
already reported by Cui and Wu,11a but
the dehydrative
coupling with (hetero)arenes is not trivial, to the best of our
knowledge.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
On the basis of our previous work on copper-mediated
dehydrogenative biaryl coupling with 1,3-azoles,8 we ﬁrst tested
the coupling reaction of quinoline N-oxide monohydrate (1a)
with 5-phenyloxazole (2a) in heating o-xylene under
representative Cu(OAc)2/PivOH-promoted conditions (Table
1). To our delight, the C−C bond-forming reaction proceeded,
but surprisingly, the observed product was not the originally
expected 3aa-O but the formally dehydrative coupling product
3aa (entry 1). Careful monitoring by GC and GCMS also
indicated no formation of 3aa-O during the course of the

optimize conditions for unique dehydrative coupling. The brief
screening of carboxylic acids proved PivOH to be the optimal
(entries 2 and 3). Subsequent investigations of bases showed
positive eﬀects of pyridine (entry 4), while other organic and
inorganic bases decreased the reaction eﬃciency (entries 5−
10). Even with basic pyridine, the addition of PivOH was still
necessary (entry 11). With 1a as the limiting reagent, the yield
signiﬁcantly decreased (entry 12). Although we subjected other
Cu(I) and Cu(II) salts instead of Cu(OAc)2, 3aa was formed in

less than 2% yield (entries 13−17). The control experiment
with the parent quinoline under otherwise identical conditions
resulted in no formation of 3aa (entry 18). In all entries of
Table 1, the major byproducts was the homocoupling product,
bisoxazole, derived from 2a,12 but the oxygen-retaining product
3aa-O was not detected at all.13
</para>
<para sub="scope">
The yield of 3aa is relatively moderate, but if the C−C
formation and deoxygenation were performed separately as in
Scheme 1a and b, the average yield of each step would be ca.
75%, which can be a useful level from the synthetic point of
view. Thus, while still preliminary, under conditions of entry 4
in Table 1 we implemented the dehydrative coupling of various
azine N-oxides 1 with 5-aryloxazole (2a). Representative
products are shown in Scheme 3. The quinoline N-oxides
bearing an electron-donating methoxy and an electron-
withdrawing chloro group at the C4 position underwent the
reaction, while the former showed better reactivity (3ba and

3ca). The conceivable C8-heteroarylation of quinoline N-
oxides was not observed at all.14 The methyl substituent at the
C8 position did not interfere with the coupling (3da), despite
its conceivable steric hindrance. The isoquinoline system could
also be employed, and C−C bond formation occurred
exclusively at the C2 position (3ea). Moreover, higher fused
azines N-oxides were also accommodated. Tricyclic benzo[h]-
quinoline and phenanthridine N-oxides coupled with 2a under
the standard conditions to furnish 3fa and 3ga in 37% and 54%,
respectively. In the case of 3fa, the C10-arylated product 3fa′
was also detected by GC and GCMS analyses, which could be
formed via Cu(II)-mediated dehydrogenative coupling of 2a
with the deoxygenated benzo[h]quinoline generated in situ.8a
However, an amount of 3fa′ was small (3% by GC), thus
indicating that
the dehydrative coupling proceeded more
smoothly. Additionally, 3fa and 3fa′ could be separated from
each other
readily by column chromatography. Simpler

monocyclic pyridine N-oxides were also promising substrates:
pyridyl, 4-methoxypyridyl, and 2-phenylpyridyl aromatic rings
were introduced to the oxazole core directly (3ha, 3ia, and 3ja).
Similar to the case of 3fa, 3ja was obtained, contaminated with
3% of ortho-arylated 3ja′. Just one exception is 2-methylpyr-
idine N-oxide, and the corresponding product 3ka was detected
in only 4% yield. This is probably because the substrate might
poison the Cu salt probably through the formation of tightly
chelated metalacycles.7a,f Particularly notable is the doubly
dehydrative coupling of quinoxaline 1,4-dioxide: two C−C
bonds were formed simultaneously to aﬀord the 2,3-bisarylated
quinoxaline 3la in one attempt. Moreover, the reaction of 1a
with 2a could be successfully performed on a 1.0 mmol scale,
and 3aa was obtained in 43% yield.

<para sub="scope">
We next investigated the scope of 1,3-azoles (Scheme 4).
The copper-based conditions were compatible with electroni-
cally diverse substituents on the oxazole,
including methyl,
methoxy, triﬂuoromethyl, methoxycarbonyl, and nitro functions
(3ab, 3ac, 3ad, 3ae, 3af, and 3bg). The naphthalene and styryl
moieties were also tolerated under reaction conditions (3ah
and 3ai). Among other 1,3-azoles, only N-methylbenzimidazole
gave the corresponding biaryl 3bj, albeit with 28% yield. As far
as we tested, thiazole, benzothiazole, and oxadiazoles produced
the desired products in less than 5% yields (data not shown).
This is the current limitation, but the observed unique reactivity
of oxazoles is complementary to the precedented Pd-catalyzed
dehydrogenative coupling of azine N-oxides and azoles.7f In
most cases, we found the competitive homocoupling of azoles
(ca. 20%), which was the major reason for the relatively low
reaction eﬃciency. The starting oxazoles were also recovered
intact in ca. 10%. The fates of others could not be identiﬁed,
but the ring opening decomposition may competitively occur.15

exchange even in the presence or absence of the coupling
partner quinoline N-oxide (1a), which was common in our
previous Cu(II)-mediated dehydrogenative couplings.8 In sharp
contrast, we observed negligible H/D scrambling of 2-
deuterioquinoline N-oxide (1a-d
1) regardless of the addition
of 5-phenyloxazole (2a). These phenomena suggest that the
C−H cupration of the oxazole occurs rapidly and reversibly,
while the azine N-oxide C−H cannot be metalated under the
present conditions.

if the second 2a reacted with 4, the

copper 4′. Although the origin of the unique reactivity of
Cu(OAc)2 observed in Table 1 is still unclear,
its inherent

important roles in the C−H cleavage of 2a and addition step of

■ CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a copper-mediated formally dehydrative
coupling of azine N-oxides and oxazoles. The Cu(II)-based
system directly provides, without an additional reduction step,
azine-containing biheteroaryls of prevalent aromatic cores in
pharmaceutical
targets and biologically active compounds.
Thus, the current work can complement the known C−H

arylation protocols of azine N-oxides,5,7 while the substrate
scope is still relatively limited. Consequently, further studies on
the detailed mechanism and development of related copper-
promoted dehydrative and dehydrogenative C−C forming
reactions are ongoing.

<para sub=“exp”>
Instrumentation and Chemicals. 1H, 13C, and 19F NMR spectra
were recorded at 400, 100, and 376 MHz, respectively, for CDCl3
solutions. HRMS data were obtained by EI or APCI using a double-
focusing mass spectrometer or TOF, respectively. GC analysis was
carried out using a silicon OV-17 column (i.d. 2.6 mm × 1.5 m) or a
CBP-1 capillary column (i.d. 0.5 mm × 25 m). Silica gel was used for
column chromatography. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was
performed with a CHCl3 eluent (3.5 mL/min, UV detector). Unless
otherwise noted, materials obtained from commercial suppliers were
used without further puriﬁcation. o-Xylene was freshly distillated from
CaH2. Azine N-oxides 1a, 1d, 1e, 1h, 1i, and 1k are commercially

reactions were carried out under N2 conditions.
Procedure for the Preparation of 2-Deuterio-5-phenyl-
oxazole (2a-d1). 5-Phenyloxazole (2a, 1.5 g, 10 mmol) was placed
in a 100 mL two-necked reaction ﬂask, which was ﬁlled with nitrogen
by using the standard Schlenk technique. The ﬂask was cooled to −78
°C with a dry ice-acetone bath, and THF (15 mL) and butyllithium
(1.64 M hexane solution, 6.7 mL, 11 mmol) were then added to the
ﬂask. After the mixture was stirred for 1 h at the same temperature,
deuterium oxide (1.8 mL, 100 mmol) was added dropwise, and the
resulting mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and
stirred for an additional 20 h. The mixture was quenched with water
and extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic layer was dried
over sodium sulfate. After concentration in vacuo, silica gel column

(13) Attempts to apply catalytic conditions with 20 mol % Cu(OAc)2
remained unsuccessful; neither 3aa nor 3aa-O was formed, and nearly
quantitative 2a was recovered. The use of AcOH as solvent was also
ineﬀective.

(17) The product can be a good N,N chelating ligand for the copper
and led to the inhibition of the remaining copper salts. However, we
did not observe such eﬀects: even in the presence of 1.0 equiv (to
Cu(OAc)2) of 3aa, the reaction of 4-methoxyquinoline N-oxide with
2a formed 3ba in a comparable yield.

(19) A related stepwise mechanism is proposed in ref 5g.
(20) The structure of 3aa-O was unambiguously determined by X-ray
analysis. Crystallographic data for the structure has been deposited
with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC 1042249).
See the Supporting Information for details.
(21) The observed rapid deoxygenation reaction was unique to 3aa-
O. Treatment of quinoline N-oxide (1a) with 2.0 equiv of Cu(OAc)2
in heating o-xylene for 4 h provided the parent quinoline in only 17%
yield, and 83% of 1a was recovered intact.
