ABSTRACT: Catalytic lactam synthesis was achieved directly
from lactones and amines using an Ir catalyst. Three sequential
transformationsaminolysis of lactone, N-alkylation of amine
with hydroxyamide, and intramolecular
transamidation of
aminoamideaﬀorded the corresponding N-substituted lac-
tams.

L actams are one of the fundamental functional molecules in

organic chemistry.1 They serve as pharmacophores in
antibiotics, antipsychotics, drug candidates, and intermediates
in the synthesis of dopamine receptors.2 Moreover, they can be
used as the monomers of versatile synthetic polymers, such as
poly(1-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one) derivatives.3 Conventional syn-
thetic methods
lactam include the intramolecular
condensation of amino acid derivatives under extremely high
temperature conditions and the use of activating reagents, such
as Grignard reagents4 and Brønsted acids.5 Moreover,
the
intramolecular cyclization of haloamides with Brønsted bases
aﬀords lactams.6 Among these methods, the lactamization of
lactones with amines is a straightforward approach because the
substrates are readily available without any prefunctionalization.
However, the previous methods for this reaction suﬀer from
harsh temperatures (220−270 °C) or high pressures7 and
require stoichiometric amounts of activating reagents8 and
multistep reactions.9 Moreover, catalytic methods also suﬀer
from the use of prefunctionalized substrates.10 Herein, we
report the ﬁrst Ir-catalyzed N-substituted lactam synthesis from
readily available lactones and amines. Mechanistic investiga-
tions indicated that three distinct C−N bond transformation
reactions occurred sequentially.

Ir-catalyzed amination of alcohols using “hydrogen auto-
transfer” has been extensively explored over the past decade.11
Our group recently reported the tandem synthesis of amides
and secondary amines from linear esters and amines via
hydrogen autotransfer using the [Cp*Ir] catalytic system.12
Inspired by these results, we expected that aminoamides could
be synthesized by the ring-opening reaction of lactones. The
reaction of γ-butyrolactone (1a) with benzylamine (2a) using
the reported Ir catalyst12 aﬀorded the corresponding lactam 1-
benzyl-2-pyrrolidinone (3aa) in 39% yield instead of
the
aminoamide (entry 5, Table 1). Encouraged by the unexpected
result, the reaction conditions were optimized for the selective
lactamization with several Ru and Ir complexes, which are well-

known for dehydrogenative C−N bond formation reactions
(Table 1).11h,13 A combination of [Cp*IrCl2]2 and a base was
identiﬁed as the best precatalyst with an additional amount of
amine (1.5−2 equiv) to achieve good yields (entries 5−7). The
use of molecular sieves as drying agents increased the eﬃciency
of the reaction by removing H2O byproducts (entry 8). The
addition of X- or L-type ligands did not improve the yield
(entries 9 and 10). Both [Cp*IrCl2]2 and NaOAc were
essential for eﬃcient conversion (entries 11 and 12).

<para sub="scope">
With the reaction conditions optimized, our method was
attempted for the synthesis of diverse N-substituted lactams
(Table 2). The reactions of 1a with a variety of benzylamines
and 3-phenylpropylamine 2h aﬀorded the corresponding
lactams in fair-to-excellent yields (entries 1−6). Electron-
deﬁcient benzylamines resulted in slightly higher conversion
than electron-rich benzylamines (entries 4 and 5). The
reactions of α-branched primary amines such (S)-(−)-α-
methylbenzylamine with 1a did not give the corresponding
lactams but only produced the corresponding hydroxyamides
and/or aminoamides. The α-methyl substituent on butyr-
olactone did not interfere with the reaction (entry 7). The
reactions of 3-isochromanone 1c with benzylamines and
aliphatic amines proceeded smoothly to aﬀord the correspond-
ing lactams in fair-to-excellent yields (entries 8−14). In the
lactamization of 1c, both electron-rich and electron-deﬁcient
benzylamines participated in the reaction eﬃciently. The
catalytic system tolerated various functional groups, including
ether, alkyl, chloro, and triﬂuoromethyl groups. Triﬂuorome-
thylated lactams 3ae and 3ce, potential building blocks for
pharmaceutical compounds,14,15 were synthesized eﬃciently
(entries 5 and 12). Linear aliphatic amine 2g was lactamized
with 1c in 71% yield (entry 14). To gain further insight into the
eﬀect of lactone ring size, we conducted the reactions of δ-

At the initial stage, hydroxyamide A was generated along with
the consumption of 1a and 2a. Subsequently, the amounts of
aminoamide B and lactam 3aa increased with the decrease in
the amounts of 1a, 2a, and A. After ∼5 h, both the amounts of
A and B gradually decreased, whereas the amount of 3aa
continuously increased. The concentration of 2a started to
increase after ∼10 h and ﬁnally remained mostly constant at
∼40% of the initial concentration.

To conﬁrm the intermediacy of hydroxyamide and amino-

with A and B were performed under catalytic conditions.
Hydroxyamide A may be formed by the nucleophilic addition
of amine to the carbonyl carbon of
lactone and the ring-
opening process. When A alone was subjected to these reaction
conditions, a small amount (21%) of 3aa was obtained
(Scheme 1). This result indicates that the direct intramolecular
cyclization of hydroxyamides to lactams via the N-alkylation of
amides is unlikely in our case. In the catalytic N-alkylation of
amides with alcohols, only primary amides were generally
applicable even under harsh reaction conditions.17 Considering
that an amine is needed for the N-alkylation of amine with A to
aﬀord the second intermediate candidate B, 1 equiv of 2a was
added to the reaction of A. The reaction smoothly aﬀorded 3aa

In conclusion, a catalytic lactam synthesis was developed
from lactones and amines using the readily available Ir complex
[Cp*IrCl2]2 and sodium acetate. The mechanistic studies
revealed an interesting domino reaction involving the following
sequential reactions: aminolysis of
lactone, N-alkylation of
amine with hydroxyamide, and intramolecular transamidation
of aminoamide.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Considerations. Unless otherwise noted, all reactions
were carried out using standard Schlenk techniques or in an Ar-ﬁlled
glovebox. NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 or toluene-d8, and
residual solvent signals were used as the reference. Chemical shifts are
reported in ppm, and coupling constants are reported in Hz.
Multiplicity is indicated by one or more of the following: singlet (s),
doublet (d), triplet (t), quartet (q), quintet (quin), sextet (sext), and
multiplet (m). High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was
performed using the fast atom bombardment (FAB) ionization mode,
electrospray ionization (ESI) Q-TOF mode, and electron ionization
(EI) mode. GC analysis was carried out using a GC system equipped
with an HP-5 column and FID detector. NHC precursor (1,3-
diisopropylimidazolium bromide),19 N-benzyl-4-hydroxybutanamide
(A),7a and N-benzyl-4-(benzylamino)butanamide (B)7a were prepared
based on literature procedures. Other chemicals were purchased from
commercial suppliers and used as received without further puriﬁcation.
General Procedure for Lactam Synthesis from Lactones and
Amines. Inside an Ar-ﬁlled glovebox, 1 mol % of [Cp*IrCl2]2 (3.98
mg, 0.005 mmol), 2 mol % NaOAc (0.82 mg, 0.010 mmol), 4 Å
molecular sieves (ca. 35 mg), and toluene (1.2 mL) were added to an
oven-dried 5 mL Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic spin bar and
septum. After the tube with the catalytic system was removed from the
box, 0.50 mmol lactone and 1.00 mmol amine were added to the tube
under an Ar ﬂow using the Schlenk technique. Then, the reaction
mixture was stirred at 110 °C for 36 h before cooling to room
temperature. All of the volatiles were removed in vacuo, and the
resulting residue was puriﬁed by ﬂash column chromatography
(hexane/EtOAc = 4:1 v/v or DCM/MeOH = 30:1 v/v) to aﬀord
the corresponding lactam.
