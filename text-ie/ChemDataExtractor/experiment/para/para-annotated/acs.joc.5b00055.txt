ABSTRACT: An asymmetric Diels−Alder reaction of 2,4-dienols and methyl
acrylate utilizing a chiral Zn(II)/Mg(II) bimetallic template with low catalyst
loading was successfully achieved. The bimetallic Lewis acid template derived from
(R)-5,5′,6,6′,7,7′,8,8′-octahydro-1,1′-bi-2-naphthol catalyzed the Diels−Alder
reaction in the presence of molecular sieves 4 Å to aﬀord various functionalized
bicyclic γ-lactones with high enantiomeric purities.

T he tethered Diels−Alder reaction is an eﬃcient and

powerful method for the stereoselective construction of
functionalized cyclohexene derivatives.1 Many advantages of the
intramolecular Diels−Alder reaction have been extended to the
intermolecular counterpart by linking the diene to the
dienophile with a temporary tether.2−8 In particular, Ward’s
enantioselective variant of the tethered Diels−Alder reaction is
remarkable (Scheme 1).9 They disclosed that the coordination

Diels−Alder reaction of 2 and methyl acrylate using (R)-
BINOL (1) as a chiral ligand following Ward’s protocol. In this
particular case, the reaction provided a 4.8:1 diastereomeric
mixture of 3a and 3b quantitatively (Table 1, entry 1).15 A

On the other hand, the reaction using a stoichiometric amount
of the bimetallic complex generated from (R)-5,5′,6,6′,7,7′,8,8′-
octahydro-1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (5), Me2Zn, and MeMgBr ex-
hibited higher selectivity to provide 3a and 3b in a ratio of 9.9:1
in 98% yield (entry 3). It should be noted that the reaction
mediated by 0.5 equiv of bimetallic complex with 5 was
completed within 2 h to aﬀord 3a in excellent yield and high
diastereoselectivity, which were similar to those observed for
the stoichiometric reaction (entry 4).16 Encouraged by this
result, we examined the reaction at lower catalyst loading.

of the diene and dienophile components to a bimetallic Lewis
acid template derived from (R)-1,1′-bi-2-naphthol ((R)-
BINOL) (1), Me2Zn, and MeMgBr eﬀectively controlled the
Diels−Alder reaction to generate the bicyclic γ-lactone regio-,
diastereo,- and enantioselectively in excellent yield. The
reaction was referred to as LACASA-DA (Diels−Alder reaction
based on a Lewis acid-catalyzed reaction of a self-assembled
complex).10−12 Ward’s protocol has been tactically employed to
enantioselectively construct functionalized cyclohexene inter-
mediates for natural product synthesis.13,14 This enantioselec-
tive reaction is highly eﬀective, but it requires a stoichiometric
quantity of BINOL−bimetallic complex to achieve an accept-
able conversion. The tethered Diels−Alder reaction with low
catalyst loading remains unexplored. Herein we report the ﬁrst
Lewis acid template-catalyzed asymmetric Diels−Alder reaction
of dienols with methyl acrylate giving the highly functionalized
bicyclic γ-lactones.

Consequently, the use of even 0.2 equiv of the catalyst was
found to eﬀectively promote the high asymmetric induction
(entry 5), whereas lowering the catalyst loading of 5 to 0.1

the
cycloaddition proceeded with moderate enantioselectivity to
aﬀord bicyclic γ-lactone 7a in 83% yield and 52% ee (entry 1).
A lower temperature did not improve the enantioselectivity
(entry 2). On the other hand, the addition of molecular sieves 4
Å resulted in a dramatic rate acceleration (entry 3). Thus, in the
presence of molecular sieves 4 Å, the reaction was completed
within 1 day to aﬀord 7a in 100% yield and 84% ee. It must be
noted that decreasing the amount of methyl acrylate markedly
improved the enantioselectivity (entries 4−6). To our delight,
the chiral template reaction of 6a and 1.5 equiv of methyl
acrylate using 5 in the presence of molecular sieves 4 Å
provided 7a in 98% yield and 92% ee. The reaction at 0 °C was
sluggish, and the enantioselectivity became moderate (entry 7).
Interestingly, even at a higher temperature (40 °C),
the
reaction proceeded without any loss of the enantioselectivity to
give 7a almost quantitatively (entry 8). A similar level of
asymmetric induction was obtained with ethyl acrylate (entries
6 and 9); however, the reactions with other acrylates exhibited
moderate enantioselectivities (entries 10−14). Concerning the

methyl-2,4-pentadienol 6e was found to be a less reactive

reaction of the substrates bearing alkyl groups at the C-3 and 4
positions provided the cycloadducts in excellent yields and
enantioselectivities (7a, 7d, 7f, and 7g). In contrast, substituted
acrylates such as methyl methacrylate and methyl crotonate
were incompatible with this cycloaddition reaction of 6a (7h

A plausible mechanism for the catalytic tethered Diels−Alder
reaction is depicted in Scheme 3. As Ward’s LACASA-DA
mechanism,9,18 magnesium octahydrobinaphthoate A and zinc
dienolate B would form bimetallic Lewis acid C, which reacts
with methyl acrylate to aﬀord self-assembled intermediate D.
The tethered intermediate D undergoes Diels−Alder reaction
in endomode (E), followed by lactonization (F). The ligand
exchange of F with methyl acrylate would release γ-lactone
product 7. The second exchange of the resulting G by dienol 6
regenerates D and releases methanol. The molecular sieves
would play an important role for the capture of the methanol to
accelerate the catalytic cycle.

Scheme 3. Plausible Mechanism for Tethered Diels−Alder
Reaction

In conclusion, we have successfully developed the catalytic
version of Ward’s LACASA-DA reaction for the ﬁrst time. The
use of a Zn(II)/Mg(II)−(R)-5,5′,6,6′,7,7′,8,8′-octahydro-1,1′-
bi-2-naphthoate template together with molecular sieves was
found to eﬀectively create the catalytic reaction system. The
present method is highly practical
in terms of yield,
enantioselectivity, and mild reaction conditions. Further
synthetic application for biologically active compounds is
undertaken in our laboratory.

<para sub=“exp”>
General Methods. Where appropriate, reactions were performed
in ﬂame-dried glassware under argon atmosphere. All extracts were
dried over MgSO4 and concentrated by rotary evaporation below 30
°C at 25 Torr. Commercial reagents and solvents were used as
supplied with following exceptions. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and
diethyl ether (Et2O) were puriﬁed by ﬁltration through a column of
activated alumina under an argon atmosphere.19 Dichloromethane
(CH2Cl2), chloroform (CHCl3), benzene (PhH), toluene (PhMe),
hexane, pyridine, and triethylamine (Et3N) were distilled from calcium
hydride. Compounds 6a,20 6b,21 6d,22 6e,23 and 6f24 were prepared
according to the literature procedure. Compound 6c is commercially
available. HRMS spectra were taken in EI (dual focusing sector ﬁeld),
ESI (TOF), or FAB (dual-focusing sector ﬁeld) mode.

(E)-6-(Benzyloxy)-4-methylenehex-2-en-1-ol (6g). To a solution of
the above-mentioned ester (2.89 g, 11.1 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (110 mL)
was added DIBAL (1.02 M in hexane; 23.7 mL, 24.2 mmol) at −78
°C. The reaction mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 15 h, saturated
aqueous Rochelle salt (100 mL) was added, and the mixture was
stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The mixture was extracted with
Et2O (100 mL × 3), dried, and concentrated. The residue was
subjected to chromatography (SiO2 100 g, hexane−AcOEt, 2:1) to
furnish 6g. Pale yellow oil, 2.00 g, 83% yield. 1H NMR (400 MHz,

General Procedure for Lewis Acid Template-Catalyzed
Diels−Alder Reactions. To a solution of 6 (1.00 mmol) in
CH2Cl2 (5 mL) was added dimethylzinc (1.02 M in hexane solution;
0.196 mL, 0.20 mmol) at 0 °C, and the mixture was stirred for 30 min.
In another vessel, MeMgBr (3.0 M in Et2O solution; 0.067 mL, 0.20
mmol) was added to a mixture of (R)-5,5′,6,6′,7,7′,8,8′-octahydro-
1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (58.9 mg, 0.20 mmol) and dried MS-4 Å powder
(200 mg) in CH2Cl2 (1.0 mL) at 0 °C, and the mixture was stirred for
30 min. The former mixture and washings with CH2Cl2 (1.6 mL) were
added to the latter one, and stirring was continued for 30 min. The
combined mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 (2.4 mL), methyl acrylate
(0.135 mL, 1.5 mmol) was added, and stirring was continued at rt for
24 h, The reaction mixture was diluted with satd NaHCO3 (5 mL) and
ﬁltered through Celite. The ﬁltrate was dried and concentrated and the
residue was subjected to chromatography (SiO2 10 g, hexane−AcOEt,
15:1 or PhMe−AcOEt, 5:1) to aﬀord the desired product.

(15) The use of (S)-BINOL in place of (R)-BINOL resulted in
opposite selectivity to give 3a and 3b in a ratio of 1:3.7 in 80% yield.
(16) Ward et al. reported the BINOL-mediated Diels−Alder reaction
was so slow that it took 14 days to complete with 0.25 equiv of BINOL
complex.
(17) The absolute conﬁguration of Diels−Alder adduct 7b was
determined by comparison with the optical
rotation of known
compounds.
