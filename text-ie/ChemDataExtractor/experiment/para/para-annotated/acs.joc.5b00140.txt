ABSTRACT: A mild and convenient protocol
for direct
synthesis of β-mannosides has been developed. Glycosylation of
4,6-O-benzylidene-protected mannosyl ortho-hexynylbenzoates
with various alcohol acceptors catalyzed by gold(I) complex
proceeded smoothly at 0 °C to room temperature and aﬀorded
the corresponding β-mannoside in high yield and satisfactory
stereoselectivity. This reaction was applied to the total synthesis
of acremomannolipin A and its analogue.

β-Mannopyranosyl unit is an essential constituent of naturally
occurring bioactive oligosaccharides and glycopeptides. Formation
of β-mannosidic linkages has long been considered one of the
most diﬃcult and challenging targets in carbohydrate chemistry
because of both anomeric eﬀects and the axial C2−O2 substituent
favoring α-mannosides when the mannosyl donors function as
glycosylation reagents.1 Among the methods reported, synthesis
of β-mannoside using mannosyl sulfoxide and thioglycoside
developed by Crich and co-workers are notable breakthroughs
(Scheme 1, eqs 1a and 1b).2,3 In these methods, preactivation and
nonpreactivation protocols have been exploited to synthesize
β-mannosides through activation of 4,6-O-benzylidene-protected
mannosyl sulfoxide or thioglycoside with the 2-OH and 3-OH
groups blocked with ether-type protective groups such as the
benzyl group by stoichiometric amounts of the appropriate
activators. The glycosylation generally proceeded with high yield
and selectivity.

Thereafter, a wide array of 4,6-O-benzylidene-protected
mannosyl donors including 2-(hydroxycarbonyl)benzyl ether,4
4-pentenoate,5 diethyl phosphite,6 hemiacetal,7 trichloroacetimi-
date,8 and N-phenyl triﬂuoroacetimide9 were successfully utilized
in the preparation of β-mannosides (Scheme 1, eqs 1c−1g).
Mannosyl donors with replacement of benzylidene by 4,6-silylene
and those without benzylidene have also been employed to
construct β-mannosides.10 In particular, the glycosylations with
4,6-silylene protected mannosyl thioglycoside were conducted
at 0 °C or room temperature and requires no preactivation.
Recently, a novel strategy involving hydrogen bond-mediated
aglycone delivery with thioglycosides bearing either picolinyl or
picoloyl group as donors has been used to construct challenging
β-manno, β-rhamno, and α-glucosides with stereoselectivities.11

Gold(I)-catalyzed glycosylation of glycosyl ortho-alkynylbenzoate
donors, introduced by Yu and co-workers,12 is a mild and versatile
method for the synthesis of various glycosides with a thoroughly
studied mechanism. To extend the methodologies of formation of
the challenging β-mannosidic bond, we herein disclose our results
on direct construction of β-mannosidic bonds with mannosyl ortho-
hexynylbenzoates as donors and its application toward the synthesis
of acremomannolipin A. Our method prepares β-mannoside in high
yield by mixing the mannosyl donor and glycosyl acceptor with the
promotion of a catalytic amount of the gold(I) complex at 0 °C to
room temperature (Scheme 1). Thus, this reaction constitutes an
operationally simple approach to the formation of β-mannosidic
linkages.
<para sub=“opt”>
Guided by the discovery that the 4,6-O-benzylidene protective
group facilitates the highly stereoselective β-mannopyranosylation,
we initially prepared ortho-hexynylbenzoate 2 as a mixture
(α/β = 3.5:1) in 82% yield. This could be readily separated by
silica gel column chromatography (Table 1). We then used
the glycosylation of 2α with rhamnosyl thioglycoside 3a as a
model reaction to determine the optimal reaction conditions.
After screenings of various combinations of gold(I) complex and
silver salt as promoter (Table 1, Entry 1), (p-MeOPh)3AuCl/
Ag[B(C6F5)4]9a emerged as the catalyst of choice. The
corresponding β-mannoside 4a was attained in 76% yield with
no α-isomer detected.

yields with exclusive stereoselectivities, some comments are
required. Versus the exclusive formation of β-mannoside 4e
(Table 1, Entry 5), compound 4f (Table 1, Entry 6) was obtained
as a 5.6:1 β/α mixture in 78% yield. The reduction in
stereoselectivity is attributed to reduced nucleophilicity of the
4-OH on acceptor 3f because of the presence of adjacent
electron-withdrawing benzoyl groups.10b β-Mannosylations of
donor 2β also performed well under the optimized conditions,
and disaccharides 4e (Table 1, Entry 9) and 4h (Table 1, Entry 8)
were both obtained in a stereocontrolled manner. Comparable
outcomes for 4e from 2α and 2β (Table 1, Entries 5 and 9)
suggest that a common active intermediate should be involved
in their glycosylation process. On the basis of these observa-
tions together with Yu’s,3a Crich’s12e and Pedersen’s10b elegant
works on glycosylation mechanism, we speculate that it is an
oxocarbenium ion occupying 4H3 and B2,5 conformations that
equilibrates with a transient contact ion pair (CIP) and is
responsible for stereoselective formation of the β-mannosidic
bond. The preferable axial acttack on energically favorable B2,5
conformations and/or SN2-like displacement of CIP by the
alcohol stereocontrol resulted in β-mannoside. However, for an
acceptor with weak nucleophilicity such as 3f, attack on 4H3
conformation, which is less stable and therefore more reactive
than B2,5, occurred as a competing reaction to give α-mannoside.
This diminished the β-selectivity of the glycosylation (Scheme 2).

Saponins are an especially important class of secondary
metabolites exhibiting diverse bioactivities.13 Recently,
the
indoditerpene saponin emindole β-mannoside has been isolated
from marine-derived strain of Dichotomomyces cejpii.14 Despite
enormous progress in the synthesis of saponins15 there are
few methods2c,d for carrying out β-mannosylation at the 3-OH
of sapogenins where a sugar chain is usually appended. Thus,
we examined applications of the present glycosylation in the
synthesis of such compounds. Couplings of typical sapogenins
including glycyrrhetic acid 3i (Table 1, Entry 10), oleanolic acid
3j (Table 1, Entry 11), diosgenin 3k (Table 1, Entry 12), and
cholesterol 3l (Table 1, Entry 13) with 2α or 2β to generate
β-mannosides 4i−4l in excellent yields and stereoselectivities

demonstrate the potential of this reaction for the synthesis of
β-mannosyl saponins.

<para sub="scope">
Inspired by Boon’s related work16 and to beneﬁt late-stage
modiﬁcations of β-mannosides, we also prepared orthogonally
protected mannosyl benzoate 6 as a donor and tested its
β-mannosylations (Table 2). Although 6α reacted with
diosgenin 3k to aﬀord saponin 7a smoothly (Table 2, Entry 1),
its couplings with 4-OH sugar acceptors 3d (Table 2, Entry 2)
and 3f (Table 2, Entry 3) showed decreased stereoselectivity;
disaccharides 7b and 7c were obtained at β/α = 8.6:1 and 1.6:1,
respectively. Galactosyl diacetonide 3g (Table 2, Entry 4), which
had shown decreased β-stereoselectivity relative to other
acceptors in sulfoxide2b and trichloroacetimidate glycosylation,8a
was treated with 6α to deliver 89% yield of 7d in a ratio of
β/α = 20:1. This is a big improvement in stereoselectivity by
comparison with the generation of 4g (64% yield, β/α = 10:1,
Table 1, Entry 7) from 2α.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
The method was extended to such acceptors as 3m and 3n
(Table 2, Entries 5 and 6) with the 6-OH free and disaccharides
7e and 7f readily obtained in 77% and 86% yields with excellent
stereoselectivity, respectively. These results indicated that 6α might
be an appropriate donor to construct β-mannosidic (1 → 6)
linkages. Additionally, easy access to disaccharide thioglycosides 4a,
4d, 7b, and 7e opens up new prospects for the synthesis of β-
mannosyl fragment-containing oligosaccharides because they could
be immediately utilized as donors in their next coupling reaction.

<para sub=“props”>
The conﬁguration of newly generated glycosidic bonds was
unambiguously assigned by both chemical shift of H-5 and one-
bond coupling constant (1JCH) of anomeric center derived from
mannosyl units. The former appeared in a region ranging from
2.9 to 3.3 ppm as a multiplet,2d which is diagnostic for 4,6-O-
benzylindene protected β-mannoside (see Section A in SI).
The latter spanned from 154 to 158 Hz, further conﬁrming the
formation of β-mannosidic linkages (see Section A in SI).17
</para>
After establishing the protocol for direct β-mannosylation of
glycosyl acceptors, we set out to synthesize acremomannolipin A,
which is a novel glycolipid composed of mannitol and per-
acylated mannopyranosyl moiety through a β-glycosidic linkage.

Our synthesis commenced with the preparation of the primary
alcohol 11 in a three-step sequence composed of selective
monotritylation of mannitol 8, benzylation of 9, and removal
of the trityl group in 10. Subjecting the benzoate 6α and 11 to
the optimal glycosylation conditions by stereocontrol
led to
β-mannoside 12 in 85% yield. Desilylation of 12 followed by
acylation with octanoic acid furnished ester 14 in 86% yield
over two steps. Removal of the benzylidene group in 14 with
transacetalization followed by deprotection of 2-methylnaphthyl
group (Nap) in 15 using 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone
(DDQ) led to the formation of 16. Condensation of 16 with
n-hexanoyl chloride in pyridine installed three hexanoates
simultaneously. Subsequent hydrogenolysis of benzyl ethers
over Pd(OH)2/C gave acremomannolipin A in two steps
in 79% yield. Thus, we accomplished the total synthesis of
acremomannolipin A in 10 steps and a 15% overall yield with
mannitol as starting material, and its 1H and 13C spectra as well as
speciﬁc rotation were fully identical to those reported.18,19a

To demonstrate the versatility of our synthesis and
facilitate investigation into structure−activity relationships, we
intended to install diﬀerent acyl groups onto the mannosyl
unit of acremomannolipin A. Such compounds have not been
documented in the literature.19 Thus, selective benzoylation20
of the primary 6′-OH in 15, and hexanoylation of 4′-OH in 18
gave 19 in 81% yield in two steps. Attempting to cleave the
naphthylmethyl group in 19 using DDQ led to a complicated
reaction, and expected alcohol 20 was isolated in only 38% yield.
However, to our delight, treatment of 19 with ceric ammonium
nitrate (CAN) in acetonitrile led to 20 in 67% yield.
Esteriﬁcation of 20 with lauroyl chloride gave 21 in 50% yield
over four steps. Final hydrogenolysis to remove the benzyl group

In conclusion, a mild and convenient method for direct
β-mannosylation of various alcohols based on gold(I)-catalyzed
glycosylation with mannosyl ortho-hexynylbenzoates as donors
has been developed. This reaction proceeded in high yield with
satisfactory stereoselectivities, and its synthetic utility was
demonstrated by the synthesis of acremomannolipin A and its

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Information. All nonaqueous reactions were carried out
under an atmosphere of argon in ﬂame- or oven-dried glassware with
magnetic stirring unless otherwise indicated. Dichloromethane for
glycosylation reactions was distilled from calcium hydride. All other
commercially obtained reagents were used as received, except where
speciﬁed otherwise. Flash column chromatography was performed on
Silica Gel H (300−400 mesh, Qingdao, China). Analytical thin layer
chromatography was performed on Silicycle SiliaPlate glass-backed
plates coated with silica gel (60 Å pore size, F-254 indicator) and
visualized by exposure to ultraviolet light and/or staining with aqueous
5% sulfuric acid in methanol. Optical rotations were determined with
a digital polarimeter. High-resolution mass spectral (HRMS) data were
determined with a LTQ Orbitrap. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were
recorded on a 500 or 600 MHz NMR spectrometer with Me4Si as the
internal standard. Chemical shifts are recorded in δ values and J values
were given in Hz. Glycosyl acceptors 3c, 3k, and 3l are commercially

mixture was stirred in the presence of ﬂame activated 4 Å molecular
sieves (200 mg) for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was
cooled to 0 °C, then AgB(C6F5)4 (10 μmol, 0.1 equiv) was added in the
dark under an atmosphere of argon. After stirring at 0 °C for 30 min,
AgB(C6F5)4 (10 μmol, 0.1 equiv) and (4-MeOPh)3PAuCl (10 μmol,
0.1 equiv) was added sequentially. The resulting mixture was allowed to
warm naturally up to room terperature. After complete consumption
of starting material as assessed by TLC, the reaction was quenched
with a few drops of triethylamine, then ﬁltered through a pad of Celite.

1,2,3,4,5-Penta-O-benzyl-D-mannitol

(11). To a solution of
D-mannitol (5 g, 27.45 mmol, 2 equiv) in anhydrous pyridine (50 mL)
was added triphenylmethyl chloride (1.91 g, 6.86 mmol, 0.5 equiv).
After the mixture was stirred at 75 °C for 12 h, another portion of
triphenylmethyl chloride (950 mg, 3.43 mmol, 0.25 equiv) was added,
and stirring was continued at 45 °C for 24 h. Then the reaction was
cooled to room termperature, and more triphenylmethyl chloride
(950 mg, 3.43 mmol, 0.25 equiv) was added, followed by stirring at room
temperature for another 36 h. At this stage the solution was concentrated
in vacuo, and the remaining solid was diluted with water (30 mL). The
aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (5 × 40 mL). The combined
organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, ﬁltered, and then concentrated to
give crude 1-O-triphenylmethy-D-mannitol (9) as a syrup. MS-ESI m/z:
447.3 [M + Na]+.

Trityl ether 9 was dissolved in anhydrous DMF (70 mL), BnBr
(12.3 mL, 102.94 mmol, 7.5 equiv), and TBAI (507 mg, 1.37 mmol,
0.1 equiv) were added. After the mixture was stirred for 10 min, NaH
(2.47 g, 102.94 mmol, 7.5 equiv) was added at 0 °C. Then the resulting
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 4 h followed by addition of
MeOH to quench the reaction. The volatile was removed in vacuum,
and the remain syrup was diluted with CH2Cl2. The solution was
sequentially washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine. The
collected organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, ﬁltered, and
concentrated to give crude 10 as a yellow syrup, which was dissolved in
MeOH:CH2Cl2 (2/1, 150 mL), and p-TsOH monohydrate (3.92 g,
20.59 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred
under an atmosphere of argon at room temperature for 3 h. Afterward,
the reaction was neutralized with Et3N, concentrated, and then diluted
with CH2Cl2 (30 mL) and sequentially washed with water and brine.
The collected organic phase was dried over Na2SO4, ﬁltered, and
concentrated. The crude was puriﬁed by ﬂash column chromatography
(petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 6:1) to give 11 (4.17 g, 6.59 mmol, 48%
