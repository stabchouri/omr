ABSTRACT: One-step, catalytic synthesis of N-arylsulfonamides via the
construction of N−S bonds from the direct coupling of sodium arylsulﬁnates
with nitroarenes was realized in the presence of FeCl2 and NaHSO3 under
mild conditions. In this process, stable and readily available nitroarenes were
used as nitrogen sources, and NaHSO3 acted as a reductant to provide N-
arylsulfonamides in good to excellent yields. A broad range of functional
groups were very well-tolerated in this reaction system. In addition, mechanistic studies indicated that the N−S bond might be
generated through direct coupling of nitroarene with sodium arylsulﬁnate prior to the reduction of nitroarenes by NaHSO3.
Accordingly, a reaction mechanism involving N-aryl-N-arenesulfonylhydroxylamine as an intermediate was proposed.

■ INTRODUCTION
N-Arylsulfonamides are ubiquitous functional scaﬀolds among
medicinally interesting molecules.1 Over 30 drugs containing
this moiety are widely used in clinical therapy.2 As such,
signiﬁcant eﬀorts have been made toward the development of
eﬃcient methods for their preparation.
routes to N-
arylsulfonamides involve the direct N−S bond formation
(Scheme 1, path a).3,4 While generally eﬀective, this approach

the most conventional

To date, one of

Scheme 1. Methods for the Synthesis of Sulfonamides

often suﬀers from the use of aromatic amines as nitrogen
sources, which are genotoxic and are undesired potential
impurities in the synthesis of active pharamaceutial
ingre-
dients.5 To obviate this drawback, the construction of N-
arylsulfonamides via metal-catalyzed C−N bond formation has
been extensively studied in the past few years (Scheme 1, path
b). Such an approach includes the reactions of sulfonamides as
nitrogen-based nucleophiles with aryl halides,6 alcohols,7
activated esters8 or arylboronic acids,9 and the amino-
sulfonation of hydrocarbons.10 This alternative route oﬀers a
straightforward strategy for the preparation of N-arylsulfona-
mides without the use of anilines; however, it is limited by the
harsh conditions,
requirement of additional bases and/or

ligands, and comparatively complicated starting materials
which must be ﬁrst synthesized. It is highly desirable in this
area to develop shortcut approaches to N-arylsulfonamides
from simple, inexpensive, and stable nitrogen sources. In this
regard, readily available nitroarenes are a potential target for
reactivity investigations. As abundant nitrogen sources, nitro-
arenes have been directly converted to a wide range of useful
nitrogen-containing compounds, such as N-alkylated amines,11
imines,12 amides,13 and aza heterocycles,14 without prior
reduction into anilines as in most traditional approaches.15
Hence, the facile assembly of N-arylsulfonamides directly from
nitroarenes would be highly attractive.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

When conducting the catalytic homocoupling of sodium
arylsulﬁnate containing nitro groups,16 we accidentally noticed
the formation of
trace amounts of sulfonamide. Further
exploration revealed that 91% yield of sulfonamide could be
obtained under the optimized conditions (see Supporting
Information, Table S1). To our disappointment, harsh
conditions (e.g., above 100 °C and 6 equiv of sodium
arylsulﬁnates) were indispensable to this reaction, which
limited its practical application. During our investigation of
this reaction, a similar situation was reported in a patent by
others.17 Moreover, how this unexpected reaction occurred is
not clear yet.

Being curious about the mechanism of this reaction, we then
performed controlled reactions between nitrobenzene and
sodium p-acetaminobenzenesulﬁnate hoping to obtain some
insights into its mechanism (Scheme 2). Surprisingly,
in
addition to the expected sulfonamide product, acetanilide and
NaHSO4 were obtained as well (Scheme 2, eq 1). After 12 h at

<para sub=“opt”>
60 °C, only a small amount of products was generated (Scheme
2, eq 2), and no reaction took place in the absence of CuCl
even at 100 °C after 12 h (Scheme 2, eq 3). These results
indicated that the desulﬁtative reaction of sodium arylsulﬁnates
occurred in the presence of CuCl at elevated temperature,
which is consistent with the reported observation,18 and the
released sulfur dioxide was oxidized to NaHSO4 even under
argon atmosphere. The generation of NaHSO4 suggested that
NaHSO3 which could be in situ generated from the desulﬁtative
reaction of a large excess amount of sodium arylsulﬁnates and
water
in the
sulfonamide formation process.19 It was then reasonable to
envision that if NaHSO3 was added to replace the in situ
generated NaHSO3 that this unexpected direct sulfonylation of
nitroarenes with sodium arylsulﬁnates might proceed at much
lower temperature and without the need of a large excess
amount of sodium arylsulﬁnates.

Then the coupling of sodium p-toluenesulﬁnate (1a) and
nitrobenzene (2a) at 60 °C was selected as a platform to
evaluate the proposed chemistry (Table 1). As we anticipated,
the desired product could be formed in 43% yield in DMSO
(Table 1, entries 1 and 2), while NaHSO3 was used as a
reductant. As the amount of NaHSO3 increased, the yield
decreased possibly due to the side reaction between nitro-
benzene and NaHSO3, which is known as the Piria reaction
(Table 1, entry 3).20 We next explored the reaction in other
solvents (Table 1, entries 4−7), and DMSO was found to be
the best choice (Table 1, entry 1).
Remarkably, during the study of catalysts (Table 1, entries
8−13), we noticed that the addition of FeCl2 to the reaction
system led to a signiﬁcant increase in yields of the isolated
product (Table 1, entry 13). Cu(OAc)2 and FeCl3 also
promoted the reaction with slightly lower eﬃciency (Table 1,
entries 10 and 12). With Cu(OAc)2 as the catalyst, the biaryl
side product generated from the desulﬁtative homocoupling of
sodium arylsulﬁnates was also detected (Table 1, entry 10).
Other metal salts were not active and gave poor yields. The
the amount of FeCl2 on the reactions was
inﬂuence of
investigated (Table 1, entries 14 and 15), and the results
showed that a FeCl2 loading of 10 mol % gave the best product
yield. The reaction temperature was also screened (Table 1,
entries 16 and 17), and 60 °C was found to be an appropriate
choice. We observed that the combination of FeCl2 and trans-
N,N′-dimethyl-1,2-diaminocyclohexane (DMDACH) showed
the best eﬃciency (Table 1, entry 21), while FeCl2 plus N,N′-
dimethylethane-1,2-diamine (DMEDA) or cyclohexane-1,2-
diamine (DACH) gave a lower reaction yield (Table 1, entries
18 and 20). Meanwhile, the addition of tetramethylethylenedi-
amine (TMEDA) just led to a decrease in yield (Table 1, entry
19).

of sodium bezenesulﬁnate (1b) with nitrobenzene, p-nitro-
toluene, and p-chloronitrobenzene gave the desired products
3ba, 3bb, and 3bi in excellent yields (Table 3, entries 1−3).
The reaction of sodium 4-methoxybenzenesulﬁnate (1c) with
nitrobenzene furnished 3ca in 92% yield (Table 3, entry 4).
When the 2,4,6 positions of sodium benzenesulﬁnate were
substituted with methyl groups (1d), the yield was reduced
dramatically to 31%, probably due to the steric hindrance
(Table 3, entry 5). Meanwhile, this reaction is also tolerant with
bromo, chloro, and ﬂuoro substituents on the aromatic rings of
sodium arylsulﬁnates, and the corresponding target products
3ea−3ga were obtained in excellent yields (85−91%; Table 3,
entries 6−8). When sodium sulﬁnate with an amino group (1h)
was subjected to this transformation, the desired product 3ha
could be obtained directly in 84% yield with the amino group
unaﬀected (Table 3, entry 9). It is noteworthy that this kind of
structural moiety in which the amino group is at the para
position of arylsulfonamides is decisive for the antibacterial
action,23 and can only be prepared through multistep synthetic
processes by the traditional methods.24 The protocol was also
applied to the synthesis of thiophene sulfonamide, giving the
desired product 3ia and 3is in 94% and 81% yield, respectively
(Table 3, entries 10 and 11). However, sodium alkylsulﬁnate
(1j) was not a suitable substrate for this transformation (Table
3, entry 12).

To gain some understanding of the mechanism for this

subjected to the conditions in the presence of 1.1 equiv

N−S bond of the sulfonamide might not be formed through
the reaction of 1a with nitrosobenzene (4), N-phenylhydroxyl-

might not be reduced to nitrosobenzene, N-phenylhydroxyl-
amine, or aniline as in the Piria reaction. It was more reasonable
to assume that the N−S bond was generated through direct
coupling of nitroarene with sodium sulﬁnate prior to the Piria
reaction. The direct coupling of nitroarene with sodium
sulﬁnate implied that N-phenyl-N-tosylhydroxylamine (7)
might be involved as an intermediate in the reaction.
Consequently, N-phenyl-N-tosylhydroxylamine (7) was pre-
pared following the literature procedure26 and treated with
NaHSO3 to furnish the sulfonamide 3aa in 86% yield (Scheme

from the coordination between sodium

Subsequently, complexation and nucleophilic addition of A to

intermediate C. Release of Fe2+ and SO4
produces N-aryl-N-arenesulfonylhydroxylamine D. Addition of
D to the bisulﬁte gives intermediate E. Finally, intermediate E
decomposes to the corresponding N-arylsulfonamide and
bisulfate which accounts for the acidity of the reaction mixture
(for details, see Supporting Information). The reductions of

■ CONCLUSIONS
In summary, an eﬃcient and convenient FeCl2-catalyzed system
for the construction of sulfonamide directly from nitroarenes
and sodium arylsulﬁnates under mild conditions has been
developed. The important feature of this method is using stable
and readily available nitroarenes as nitrogen source and
inexpensive sodium bisulﬁte as reductant, which makes it
eﬃcient and practical. The process also exhibits signiﬁcant
functional group tolerance and allows for the preparation of a
number of N-arylsulfonamides in good to excellent yields. The
importance of
the sulfonamide scaﬀold would render this
protocol attractive for both synthetic and medicinal chemistry.
Meanwhile, based on the experimental observations, a novel
and interesting mechanism for this reaction is proposed.
