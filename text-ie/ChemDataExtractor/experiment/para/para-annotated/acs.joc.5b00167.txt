ABSTRACT: An eﬃcient synthesis of phenols via Pd-catalyzed, pyridyl-directed
homogeneous hydroxylation of the aryl C−H bond was developed, in which tert-
butyl hydroperoxide was used as the sole oxidant. The method had a broad group
tolerance and was available for both electron-rich and electron-deﬁcient substrates.
The reaction of a series of 2-arylpyridine derivatives gave the ortho-hydroxylation
products in moderate to good yields.

A s a class of important compounds, phenols are naturally

abundant. Besides their application in organic synthesis,
phenols are major constituents of many biological and natural
compounds and almost ubiquitously exist in the structural
organization of plants and animals.1 Phenolic compounds were
generally industrially synthesized by multistep procedures as
represented by the cumene process.1b In view of green and
sustainable chemistry as well as in economic terms, a direct
C(sp2)−H bond hydroxylation for phenol synthesis with an
inexpensive oxidant and without any sacriﬁcial reactant
is
desired. Transition-metal-catalyzed C(sp2)−H bond function-
alization provided the possibility for this transformation.1a,2
Though the transition-metal-catalyzed C−O bond formation is
considered to be more diﬃcult compared with C−C and some
other C−heteroatom bonds,3 there have been many successful
examples in this regard. A range of palladium-catalyzed
the C(sp2)−H bond were developed.4
alkoxylations of
Moreover, a series of encouraging progress on the direct
oxidation of aryl C(sp2)−H bonds catalyzed by transition
metals to form phenols have also been achieved in recent years.
These hydroxylations regioselectively took place at the ortho-
position of aromatic rings directed by the carbonyl,5 ester,6
carbamyl,7 carbamate,8 carboxyl,9 acylamino,10 phosphate,11
and some azacyclic groups.12 After the ortho-hydroxylation of
the aryl moiety of 2-arylpyridines using Pd(OAc)2/oxone in
PEG-3400/t-BuOH reported by Kim et al.,12a Jiao et al.12b
developed a novel PdCl2 and NHPI (N-hydroxyphthalimide)-
cocatalyzed aromatic C(sp2)−H bond hydroxylation of 2-
phenylpyridines,
in which molecular oxygen was used as a
heterogeneous oxidant for this transformation. Patel et al.12e
also obtained a hydroxylation product of 2-phenylpyridine by
using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant in their
study on the palladium-catalyzed acylation of 2-phenyl-
pyridines, but further study was not done. In our continuous
study on the palladium-catalyzed oxidative coupling reaction,
we found that the peroxide could be an eﬀective homogeneous

oxidant for C−H bond functionalization.13 We herein present
an eﬃcient method for the synthesis of phenols via Pd-
catalyzed, pyridyl-directed homogeneous hydroxylation of the
aryl C−H bond using TBHP as the sole oxidant.
<para sub=“opt”>
We initiated our study by employing 2-phenylpyridine (1a)
as the reactant in the presence of catalyst and TBHP (Table 1).
Without the palladium catalyst, the reaction could not take
place at all (entry 1). Thus, Pd(OAc)2, PdCl2, Pd(PPh3)2Cl2,
and Pd(CH3CN)2Cl2 were tested for this transformation,
in
which Pd(OAc)2 was proven to be the most eﬀective (entries 5
and 14−16). The oxidation reaction could be catalyzed by 5
mol % of Pd(OAc)2 to give the hydroxylation product 2-
(pyridin-2-yl)phenol (2a) in 58% yield using 4.0 equiv of
TBHP as the oxidant in DCE (1,2-dichloroethane) (entry 3).
The amount of the oxidant had an evident eﬀect on this
oxidation. In the absence of TBHP, no desired product was
detected (entry 2). Increasing TBHP to 6.0 equiv led to a
higher yield of 82% (entry 5); further increasing it to 7.0 equiv
did not improve the yield (entry 6). Another inﬂuencing factor
the reaction
of
proceeded smoothly and gave the highest yield;
in TCE
(1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), the hydroxylation product with a
lower yield of 79% was obtained (entry 8). In CH3CN, dioxane,
or DMF, however, only trace desired product was found
(entries 9−11). The reaction temperature was also crucial. The
appropriate temperature was proven to be 115 °C. Increasing
the temperature to 125 °C failed to further increase the yield
(entry 13), but at 100 °C, only 43% yield was obtained (entry
12). It is noticeable that, when the reaction proceeded in
nitrogen atmosphere, a result similar to that in air was obtained
(entry 17).

aUnless otherwise speciﬁed, the reactions were carried out in a sealed
tube in the presence of 2-phenypyridine (1a, 0.3 mmol), solvent (1

Table 2. The meta- or para-halogenated substrates were
compatible with the process and aﬀorded corresponding
hydroxylated products in good yields (2c−2h). However, 2-
(2-ﬂuorophenyl)pyridine gave the desired product
in a
relatively lower yield of 55% (2b), which might be because of
the steric eﬀect. Arenes containing other electron-withdrawing
groups also aﬀorded the expected product with good yields,
except in the case of carbonyl or ester-containing compounds,
which only gave moderate yields (2n, 2o). Interestingly, the
reaction of 2-(naphthalen-2-yl)pyridine gave a β-hydroxylation
product (2w), which might also be attributed to the less steric
its β-position. The large conjugated reactant
hindrance of
benzo[h]quinolone also gave a 10-hydroxylated product in 79%
yield (2x). Some substrates with electron-donating groups
seemed to be disadvantageous to the reaction. For example,
moderate yields were obtained from methoxy-, ethyl-, or n-
pentyl-substituted 2-phenylpyridines (2p, 2s, 2t), and the exact
reason is not clear. In general, formation of the dihydroxylation
product was not observed, and for meta-substituted substrates,
the hydroxylation proceeded at the less sterically hindered
position with high regioselectivity. It must be pointed out that,
when 7 mmol (1.09 g) 1a was used, product 2a was still
achieved with a yield of 79%, which demonstrated the practical
utility of the present method.

A control experiment was also carried out (Scheme 1). A
radical-trapping reagent 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy
(TEMPO) was added in the reaction mixture of 1a under
the established reaction conditions. The results showed that, in
the presence of 2 equiv of TEMPO, the yield of 2a was reduced
to 30%, and when the amount of TEMPO was increased to 4
equiv, a yield lower than 10% was obtained (Scheme 1). The

As mentioned in our optimization of reaction conditions,
when the reaction proceeded in nitrogen atmosphere, a result
similar to that in air was obtained (Table 1, entry 17), which
revealed that TBHP was the sole hydroxyl source. On the basis
of our experimental results and related reports,14 we proposed a
possible mechanism for this direct hydroxylation of the aryl C−
H bond (Scheme 2). Initially, the chelation-assisted C−H
activation at the ortho-position of the directing group with
Pd(OAc)2 formed a Pd(II) intermediate A. Homolysis of
TBHP gave HO• and t-BuO•,13 which could abstract a
hydrogen radical from HOAc, then release AcO•, followed by
oxidative addition of HO• and AcO• to form Pd(IV)
intermediate B. Finally, reductive elimination of B gave the
product 2a and regenerated the Pd(II) species.
In summary, a simple method for the synthesis of phenols by
Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed, pyridyl-directed aryl sp2 C−H bond
activation using TBHP as the sole oxidant and without any
ligand has been explored. Various substituents on the aryl ring,
including some coupling-reaction-sensitive groups (Cl, Br),
tolerated the reaction and gave the hydroxylation products in
moderate to good yields.

ortho-Hydroxylation of 2-Arylpyridines and Characterizations.
A mixture of 2-arylpyridines 1 (0.3 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (3.4 mg, 5 mol
%), and TBHP (0.25 mL, 6.0 equiv, 70% aqueous solution) combined
in DCE (1 mL) was sealed in a 25 mL tube with a Teﬂon-lined cap.
The tube was then placed in an oil bath, stirred, and heated at 115 °C
for 20 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the reaction mixture
was quenched with brine and extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL
× 3). The combined organic layer was dried with anhydrous Na2SO4,
and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The crude product was
puriﬁed over a column of silica gel (eluant: hexane/ethyl acetate) to
aﬀord the desired product 2.
