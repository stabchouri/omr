ABSTRACT: α-Chlorocarbanions generated via base-induced
vicarious nucleophilic substitution reaction of alkyl dichlor-
oacetates with nitroarenes react with Michael acceptors to give
esters of cyclopropane carboxylic acids substituted with p-
nitroaromatic rings.

■ INTRODUCTION

A cyclopropane ring is present in many biologically active
compounds and pharmaceuticals.1 Substituted cyclopropanes
are valuable intermediates in the synthesis of larger carbo- and
heterocyclic rings via three-membered ring opening, followed
by cycloaddition.2 Because of that, synthesis of substituted
cyclopropanes is of substantial interest and is the subject of
many publications.3 In general, there are two major ways of
construction of cyclopropane rings: addition of carbenes and
carbenoids to CC double bonds and intramolecular 1,3-
substitution in carbanions containing nucleofugal groups in γ-
positions. The second pathway includes generation of γ-
halocarbanions via addition of α-halocarbanions to Michael
acceptors, deprotonation of γ-haloalkyl sulfones, esters and
nitriles of γ-haloalkanoic acids, alkylation of methylenic
carbanions with 1,2-dihaloalkanes, and reactions of Michael
acceptors with ylides. Because of their instability, the reactions
of α-halocarbanions with Michael acceptors are usually carried
out via deprotonation of α-haloalkenoic nitriles, esters, sulfones,
etc., in the presence of the Michael acceptors.

In this paper, we wish to report the synthesis of substituted
cyclopropanes in reaction of Michael acceptors with α-
chlorocarbanions generated via vicarious nucleophilic substitu-
tion (VNS) of hydrogen in nitroarenes.

VNS is a general reaction between α-halocarbanions and
nitroarenes that proceeds via addition of the carbanions to the
electron-deﬁcient nitroaromatic rings in positions occupied by
hydrogen to form σH adducts. Further base-induced β-
elimination of hydrogen halide results
in formation of
nitrobenzylic carbanions of the products. Protonation of these
carbanions gives products of replacement of the ring hydrogen
with the carbanion moiety (Scheme 1).4

Besides of protonation to give products of VNS,

these
nitrobenzylic carbanions can be directly introduced into further
reactions with electrophilic reagents: alkylation,5 Wittig−
Horner reaction,6 nitroarylation,7 etc.

VNS reaction of α,α-dichlorocarbanions such as those
generated by deprotonation of alkyl dichloroacetates8a or
dichloromethyl phenyl sulfone8b with nitroarenes gives nitro-
benzylic α-chlorocarbanions that, upon protonation, produces
typical VNS products.8 It was already reported that such
nitrobenzylic α-chlorocarbanions, products of VNS reaction
between nitroarenes and carbanions of dichloromethyl oxazo-
line, can enter
the Darzens condensation with aromatic
aldehydes to give oxiranes.9

therefore, expected that nitrobenzylic α-chlor-
ocarbanions produced in the VNS reaction between alkyl
dichloroacetates and nitroarenes should be able to add to
electron-deﬁcient alkenesMichael acceptors giving as the
ultimate productsesters of cyclopropane carboxylic acids
substituted with nitroaromatic rings.

We have,

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“opt”>
In the preliminary experiments, we have attempted reactions of
t-butyl α-chloro-α-(4-nitrophenyl)acetate,
isolated product of
VNS between nitrobenzene 1 and t-butyl dichloroacetate with
liquid−solid PTC
acrylonitrile and ethyl acrylate under
conditionsin the presence of solid K2CO3 in DMF and
tetrabutyl ammonium hydrogen sulfate catalyst.10 The reaction
proceeded smoothly to give substituted cyclopropanes in high
yields as mixtures of stereoisomers. These results prompted us
to perform a one-pot process: formation of the nitrobenzylic α-
halocarbanions in the VNS reaction of t-butyl dichloroacetate
with nitroarenes, followed by addition of the Michael acceptors
to the reaction mixtures. The reaction of nitrobenzene with the
bulky carbanion of t-butyl dichloroacetate carried out in the
t-BuOK in DMF at −5 °C is a fast process,

From the results presented in Table 1, it can be seen that
reactions of α-halocarbanions generated via VNS of nitroarenes
with t-butyl dichloroacetate with acrylonitrile to produce
cyclopropanes 1a−6a are not stereoselective. Isomers cis and
trans are formed in almost equal quantities. On the other hand,
the reaction with ethyl acrylates is highly stereoselective. The
ratio of stereoisomers of products 1b−6b is around 8:1 or only
one isomer is formed, whereas the reaction with diethyl maleate
proceeds stereoselectively, giving single stereoisomers 1c−6c.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
The ratio of the stereoisomers can reﬂect the stereochemistry
of the intramolecular 1,3-substitution in the γ-chlorocarban-
ion−the Michael adducts or can be aﬀected by epimerization of
the C−H acidic chiral center of the products in the strongly
basic reaction media. When separated major stereoisomer 2a′

epimerization was observed. We can, therefore, suppose that
the ratio of stereoisomers is controlled thermodynamically.

The structure of the products was established on the basis of
high-resolution 1H NMR spectra. Since analysis of values of the
chemical shifts and coupling constants was insuﬃcient for
determination of the mutual location of the functional groups
CN and COOtBu in 1a−6a, and COOEt and COOtBu in 1b−
6b, this question was solved using NOE. Thus, irradiation of
selected protons of the cyclopropane rings aﬀected protons of
the aromatic rings; thus, the mutual location of the functional
groups could be unambiguously established. On this basis, the
major isomer 3a′ was assigned cis geometry (CN and COOtBu
are on the one side of the cyclopropane ring), whereas 3a″ is a
trans isomer. Spectra of other isomeric products major isomers
1a′−6a′ and minor isomers 1a″−6a″ are very similar to those
of 3a′ and 3a″; hence, we consider that 1a′−6a′ have cis and
1a″−6a″ and 1a″−6a″ have trans geometry (Scheme 3).

In order to expand the scope of this cyclopropane synthesis
and show its general character, we have attempted the reaction

The reaction of o-bromonitrobenzene 4 and o-nitroanisole 5

2-en-1-one carried out under the standard conditions, gave

■ CONCLUSION
We have shown that p-nitrobenzylic α-chlorocarbanions readily
produced in the VNS reaction of t-butyl dichloroacetate with
nitroarenes add to a variety of Michael acceptors to generate γ-
chlorocarbanions that enter intramolecular substitution, giving
esters of cyclopropane carboxylic acids containing p-nitroaryl

This simple generation of the active intermediates opens a
versatile way of synthesis of a variety of substituted cyclo-

organic synthesis.14
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General

1H and 13C,

Information. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were
recorded at a temperature of 298 K in CDCl3 solutions (in some cases,
C6D6 was also used) with a 500 MHz apparatus (500 and 125 MHz,
respectively). To assign the structures under
for
consideration, the following 1D and 2D experiments were employed:
1H selective NOESY 2D: COSY and 1H−13C gradient selected HSQC.
The 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are given relative to the TMS
signal at 0.0 ppm. The concentration of
solutions used for
measurements was about 15−30 mg of compounds in 0.6 mL of
solvent. Mass spectra were recorded using an electron spray ionization
(ESI) technique. Melting point temperatures were determinated with a

heating rate of 5 °C/min and were uncorrected. Column
chromatography was performed using silica gel 60 (0.040−0.063
mm). Thin-layer chromatography was performed on precoated silica
gel plates and visualized under a UV lamp. For column
chromatography, hexane/ethyl acetate mixtures were used as the
eluents. Solid cyclopropanes were recrystallized from hexane/Et2O. All
solvents were distilled before use. Dry DMF was obtained by
distillation from CaH2. tert-Butyl dichloroacetate, ethyl chloro(2-nitro-
5-chlorophenyl)acetate, and t-butyl chloro(4-nitrophenyl)acetate were
prepared according to a literature procedure adequately.8a,c All other
chemicals were commercial and used as received.

General Procedure for Synthesis of Substituted Cyclo-
propanes. To a suspension of potassium t-butoxide (243 mg, 2.1
mmol) in dry DMF (3 mL) cooled to −5 °C under argon, a solution
of a nitroarene (1.0 mmol) and tert-butyl dichloroacetate (206 mg, 1.1
mmol) in DMF (1 mL) was added at once. The mixture was stirred at
−5 °C for 5 min, and DMF (5 mL) and a solution of a Michael
acceptor (1.5 mmol) in DMF (2 mL) were added. The cooling bath
was removed, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature until
VNS product was consumed (TLC control). The reaction mixture was
poured in water (20 mL), and the product was extracted with
dichloromethane (3 × 15 mL). The combined extract was washed with
water (3 × 20 mL) and dried, and the solvent was evaporated. The
products were puriﬁed by column chromatography on silica gel,
hexane−ethyl acetate eluent. Evaporation of the solvent gave ﬁnal
products as
stereoisomers. Ratio of
stereoisomers was determined by 1H NMR using integration of
diagnostic signals of methylene protons.

Reaction of Ethyl Chloro(2-nitro-5-chlorophenyl)acetate
with Acrylonitrile under Solid−Liquid PTC Condition. To a
suspension of anhydrous potassium carbonate (1382 mg, 10 mmol) in
− (34 mg, 0.1 mmol) was added,
dry DMF (10 mL), solid Bu4N+HSO4
at room temperature. The mixture was intensively stirred for 10 min,
and a solution of ethyl chloro(2-nitro-5-chlorophenyl)acetate (1
mmol) and acrylonitrile (1.5 mmol) in 5 mL of DMF was added. The
mixture was stirred at room temperature until aryl ester was consumed
(TLC control). The reaction mixture was poured in water (20 mL),
and the product was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 15 mL).
The combined extract was washed with water (3 × 20 mL) and dried,
and the solvent was evaporated. The products were puriﬁed by column
chromatography on silica gel, hexane−ethyl acetate eluent. Evapo-
