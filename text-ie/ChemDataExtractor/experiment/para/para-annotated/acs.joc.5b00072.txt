ABSTRACT: A procedure has been developed for the concise synthesis of hexahydro-1H-isoindole derivatives starting from
phenacyl bromides. The approach employs a sequence involving an initial indium-mediated allenylation reaction of an arylacyl
bromide with propargyl bromide. This process is followed by FeBr3-mediated SN2′-type substitution reaction of the formed
homoallenic bromohydrin to produce a 2,5-dibromo-4-aryl-1,3-pentadiene, which then is subjected to a sequential, one-pot N-
alkylation reaction with N-allyl-N-(p-tosyl)amine and a highly diastereoselective intramolecular Diels−Alder reaction of the
formed ene-diene to generate the target hexahydro-1H-isoindole.

S ubstances possessing the 3a-phenyl-isoindoline ring system

display potent analgesic activities.1 As a result, methods for
the preparation of this unique structural scaﬀold are in high
demand. One obvious approach to construct
fused
heterocyclic framework, by using an intramolecular [4 + 2]
starting with α-
cycloaddition and N-alkylation protocol
bromomethylstyrene and pentadienyl amine, failed, owing to
the inherent instability of the amine (a, Scheme 1).1 In another

initial
approach to the polyhydro-1H-isoindole scaﬀold,
secondary amine induced ring opening of
thiophene-1,1-
dioxide to form the azatriene was found to take place in only
a 31% yield, and the ensuing intramolecular Diels−Alder
reaction was low yielding (11%, b, Scheme 1).2 Other examples
of strategies devised for synthesis of polyhydro-1H-isoindoles
rely on key rhodium(I)-catalyzed,3
thermo,4 and BCl3-

promoted intramolecular Diels−Alder
reactions.5 Recently,
the novel cis-octahydro-1H-isoindole 1 was shown to be a
potent triple serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine trans-
porter inhibitor for use as a potential drug to treat depression.6
The construction of the skeleton of 1 was accomplished by
employing either a palladium-catalyzed arylation reaction of a
fused γ-lactone or a Diels−Alder reaction of an aryl-maleic
anhydride (c and d, Scheme 1).

In the study described below, we explored a new method for
the synthesis of cis-bicyclic-polyhydro-1H-isoindoles containing
a stereogenic, quaternary, aryl-substituted bridgehead carbon.
For this purpose, we designed an approach that relies on an
intramolecular [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of an amine
tethered ene-aryldiene. Recently, we described a method for the
eﬃcient synthesis of homoallenic halohydrins 2 (Scheme 2)
that
involves an indium-mediated allenylation reaction of
arylacyl halides with propargyl bromide in aqueous media.7 In
a manner that is similar to the reported generation of 2-halo-
1,3-dienes by using halide-ion-promoted SN2′-type substitution
reactions of allenols,8 we observed that 2-aryl-1,4-dibromo-
penta-2,4-dienes 3 can be prepared by reactions of homoallenic
bromohydrins 2 with FeBr3. We envisioned that bromo-dienes
3 would serve as eﬀective substrates
in reactions with
allylamines that take place by a one-pot, sequential nucleophilic
substitution and intramolecular [4 + 2] cycloaddition of the
intermediate amine tethered ene-dienes. If valid, the proposed
pathway would serve as a simple method for the synthesis of
7a-aryl-6-bromo-hexahydro-1H-isoindoles 4 (Scheme 2).

enone 3a′, which can be easily removed by using chromatog-
raphy. Because the yield of 3a is not improved signiﬁcantly by
using larger amounts of ferric bromide (Table 1, entry 3 vs 4),
ideal conditions for this process involve the use of 40 mol % of
ferric bromide. An examination of the 3a showed that it is
stable when stored below 0 °C but that it slowly decomposes at
room temperature.

The preparation and FeBr3-promoted reactions of a variety of
aryl-substituted homoallenic bromohydrins 2 were explored
next (Table 2). The results show that
indium-mediated
allenylation reactions of arylacyl bromides with propargyl
bromide in aqueous media take place to form the desired
homoallenic bromohydrins in high yields along with small
amounts of both the propargyl analogues and corresponding
methylketones, generated by direct reduction of the arylacyl
bromides. Pure homoallenic bromohydrins 2a, 2e, and 2g,
obtained by using the previously described chromatographic
procedure,7 were observed to undergo FeBr3-mediated SN2′-
type substitution reactions to give the respective bromo-dienes
3a, 3e, and 3g in high yields (Table 2, entries 1, 5, and 7).
Alternatively, the crude mixtures generated in the indium-
mediated allenylation reactions were subjected to the FeBr3-
mediated SN2′-type substitution reaction conditions. The
results of these two-step reactions, listed in Table 2 (entries
2−4, 6, and 8), show that bromo-dienes 3 are generated in
modest yields even when puriﬁcations of the intermediate
homoallenic bromohydrins 2 are not performed. It is worth
noting that the FeBr3-mediated SN2′-type substitution reactions
of homoallenic bromohydrins 2 not only occur with high levels
of regioselectivity but also form the Z-stereoisomers selectively,
as was demonstrated by using X-ray crystallographic analysis of

inorganic bases such as cesium carbonate and potassium
carbonate promoted formation of the target 4c in respective
58% and 70% yields (Table 3, entries 4 and 5). A screen of
solvents showed that acetonitrile is an ideal solvent for the two-
step process. Importantly, neither the precursor ene-diene nor
the cyclization product 4c is formed in reactions in dichloro-
ethane or toluene (Table 3, entries 6 and 9) and that 4c is
generated in low yields when ethanol and dioxane are
employed as solvents (Table 3, entries 7 and 8). A single
diastereoisomer is produced in the reaction of 3c with N-allyl-
N-(p-tosyl)amine. The stereochemistry of the fused-bicyclic

General Procedure for the Synthesis Hexahydro-1H-iso-
indoles 4. A mixture of bromo-diene 3 (0.6 mmol), N-allyl-N-(p-
tosyl)amine (110 mg, 0.5 mmol), and K2CO3 (138 mg, 1.0 mmol) in
CH3CN (3.0 mL) was stirred at 87 °C overnight. The mixture was
cooled to ambient temperature (25−28 °C) and ﬁltered through a
ﬁlter paper. The ﬁltrate was transferred to a separatory funnel,
followed by addition of CH2Cl2 (10 mL) and water (10 mL). The
aqueous layer was back extracted with CH2Cl2 (5 mL × 2). The
combined organic layers were washed with brine (10 mL), dried over
MgSO4, and concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The crude product
was triturated with Et2O (5 mL), followed by ﬁltration to give the
product 4.
