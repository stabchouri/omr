ABSTRACT: Herein we showcase the use of a combination of 1H, 13C, and
77Se NMR spectroscopy as a sensitive tool for correlation analysis. A series of
substituted O-aryl selenocarbamates [ArOC(Se)N(CH3)2] and Se-aryl
selenocarbamates [ArSeC(O)N(CH3)2] have been investigated by means
of 1H, 13C, and 77Se NMR spectroscopy. We have determined the 1H, 13C,
and 77Se chemical shift values as well as both one- and two-bond
heteronuclear 13C−77Se coupling constants, and the changes in both the
chemical shift values and the coupling constants were found to obey linear
− constants. For the eight
free energy relationships with Hammett’s σ
studied O-aryl selenocarbamates, we observe linear free energy correlations
with two of the 13C and 77Se chemical shift values and as well as one
13C−77Se coupling constant. With the ﬁve examples of Se-aryl selenocarba-
mates, linear correlations are observed with three diﬀerent 13C−77Se coupling
constants. The strong internal consistency validates the use of 77Se NMR spectroscopy for correlation analysis.

■ INTRODUCTION

Correlations between thermodynamic and kinetic parameters
are important for elucidating reaction mechanisms, and the
relationship between parameters known as
substituent
constants, which appear in linear free energy expressions,
and various directly measurable quantities has
received
signiﬁcant attention.1 Such correlations are often discussed
using the various Hammett substituent constants, such as σ,
σ+, and σ−.2,3

Over

the years, numerous

studies have shown how
Hammett substituent constants can correlate linearly with
not only reaction rates and equilibrium constants but also
infrared frequencies, ultraviolet absorption spectra, and NMR
spectral parameters of various conjugated compounds. This
free energy correlation is not
surprising since Hammett
substituent constants are a measure of the relative eﬀect of the
substituents on the electron density at the studied site and
should therefore be able to correlate with other properties
that reﬂect
the electron distribution within the molecule.
Through this connection, it is possible to gain knowledge of
reaction mechanisms and structure−property relationships,
two concepts that are fundamental in chemistry.4−6

1H and 13C chemical shift values are frequently used for the
study of the transmission of electronic eﬀects of substituents
in conjugated organic molecules.7−9 Since the electron density
around the nucleus of
is mostly aﬀected by the
electron-donating or -withdrawing ability of the substituent, a
free energy
correlation, based on the theory of
relationships, between the observed chemical shifts (δ
X) and
Hammett substituent constants (σ) can be found (eq 1),

correlations with eq 1 would indicate that the substituent
eﬀects on the chemical shift values of the studied compounds
are electronic in origin.

it is not unusual

Coupling constants are another major parameter obtained
by NMR spectroscopy that has shown to be able to obey
linear free energy relationships with Hammett’s σ constants of
the substituents.11,12 In general, the magnitude of a coupling
constant depends on the number of bonds
intervening
between the two interacting atoms or groups of atoms. In
addition, the electronegativity of potential attached atoms or
inﬂuence also plays a

is a physical
parameter that is expressed as a function of the electronic
distribution within the molecule it will also reﬂect diﬀerences
in the electronic structure brought about by the presence of
diﬀerent substituents. This correlation can be expressed as a
linear free energy relationship in the same manner as in eq 1.
It is important that the change of the physical parameter
that
is monitored is convincingly large when constructing
Hammett plots. Data obtained using 1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopy is often used as the input to Hammett plots, and

Selenium has six naturally occurring isotopes where only one
of them, 77Se (7.58%), is NMR active having a nuclear spin
quantum number of I = 1/2. 77Se resonances are known to
show a remarkable sensitivity toward small changes in the
electronic structure of
the selenium atom and its directly
bonded atom which is why they appear in a wide range of
about 3000 ppm. In addition, the 13C−77Se coupling constants
vary from 45 to 250 Hz and the 1H−77Se coupling constants
are shown in a range of 60 Hz. All this makes 77Se NMR

The sensitivity to changes in electronic structure is reported
to be about six times greater for the selenium resonances than
for the carbon resonances on a similarly located carbon.19 The
studied compounds do not
let us make this direct
comparison; however, there was still a clear trend that the
electronic distribution at selenium is much more sensitive to
changes in substituents than that at
the adjoining carbon
atom. This may be caused by the greater polarizability of
selenium compared to carbon.20 This trend also transpired in
the linear free energy relationship that was found between the
77Se chemical shifts and the 13C chemical

selenocarbamate in compound 1 (R2 = 0.966; Figure 2e).

From the studied O-aryl selenocarbamates 1 and Se-aryl
selenocarbamates 2 we were able to observe both one- and
two-bond heteronuclear couplings between the 13C−77Se
nuclei. The nJC−Se is also observed in the 13C NMR spectrum
in the form of
symmetrically placed satellite signals
surrounding the main peak, each having ∼3.8% of
the
intensity of this peak (Figure 1b). The magnitude of the one-
bond 13C−77Se coupling constants (1JC−Se) between the
carbamate carbon and the selenium atom in 1 was in the
range of 236.5 Hz (X = OCH3) to 241.6 Hz (X = NO2). It
has been reported that the Fermi contact interaction is the
dominant mechanism inﬂuencing the 1JC−Se coupling.21,22
Consequently, the magnitude of the 1JC−Se coupling strongly
depends on the hybridization of the carbon atom. While sp3
hybridizations are leading to relatively small values of 1JC−Se,
an increase in s-character gives an increase in the magnitude.
Ranges reported in the literature are 45−100 Hz for selenium
attached to sp3 carbon atoms, 90−174 Hz for sp2 carbons in
CC−Se systems containing partial double bond character
while the coupling increases to 203−249 Hz for systems
containing a true CSe bond.13,21 The high 1JC−Se values
obtained from 1 therefore correspond well with the previous
ones observed in the literature. By plotting the 1JC−Se values as
a function of Hammett’s σ
p constants, a linear regression was
found (R2 = 0.986; Figure 4a). The fact that we observe a
linear free energy relationship between 1JC−Se and the σ
p
constants is good evidence that the change in 1JC−Se results
from electronic eﬀect of the substituents. The magnitude of
1JC−Se
found to increase with the greater electron-
withdrawing power of the substituents. This can be explained
by looking at the lone pair electrons on the oxygen atom that
will
interact strongly with the aromatic ring when electron-
withdrawing substituents are present. This interaction will
weaken the delocalization toward the carbonyl carbon atom
and thus give rise to an increase in the C−Se bond order and
thereby a higher coupling constant.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Compound 2 retains two 1JC−Se couplings: one between the
selenium atom and the ipso carbon and one to the carbamate
carbon. Since the involved carbon atoms are both sp2
hybridized, a lower coupling constant was therefore to be
expected. The 1JC−Se couplings were measured in the 13C
NMR spectra to be between 92.6−123.6 Hz
thereby
conﬁrming how the 1JC−Se coupling constant indeed depends
the two 1JC−Se couplings,
on the hybridization. Besides
compound 2 also gives rise to a 2JC−Se coupling between
the ortho carbon and the selenium atom. The two-bond
13C−77Se coupling constant has a magnitude of 10.4−11.3 Hz
showing how the coupling decreases as the distance between
the two interacting nuclei increases. These values correspond
nicely with previous reported 2JC−Se couplings that are shown
to be in the range 5−30 Hz for various systems.22,23 Plotting
both the 1JC−Se and 2JC−Se couplings in 2 as a function of
− constants gave rise to linear correlations (R2 =

0.958, 0.975, and 0.934; Figure 4b, 4c, and 4d) indicating that
the size of 1,2JC−Se correlates well with the electronic eﬀects
transmitted through the aromatic ring. The ρ value is negative
in Figure 4b while it is positive in Figure 4c and 4d. The two
latter show us therefore how electron-withdrawing substitu-
ents here increase the magnitude of 1,2JC−Se by increasing both
