ABSTRACT: A concise synthetic methodology for new
heterocyclic scaﬀolds, such as pyrazolo-pyrrolo-pyrazine and
pyrazolo-pyrrolo-diazepine skeletons, was developed. The key
features of this method include (i) synthesis of pyrrole-derived
α,β-alkynyl ketones, (ii) introduction of various substituents
into the alkyne functionality by Sonogashira cross-coupling,
(iii) synthesis of pyrazole units by the reaction of α,β-alkynyl compounds with hydrazine monohydrate, (iv) gold-catalyzed
cyclization of pyrazoles with alkyne units, and (v) cyclization with NaH. Furthermore, this methodology allows various
substituents to be introduced into all positions of the target compounds.

■ INTRODUCTION

Heterocycles play a central role in the design of biologically
active molecules and advanced organic materials. The synthesis
of pyrazoles1 has been extensively studied. Pyrazines2 represent
a class of particularly interesting heterocycles due to their
potential antiarrhythmic,3 antiamnesic, antihypoxic,4 psycho-
tropic,5 antihypersensitive,6 and aldose reductase inhibition
activities.7
Ring closure reactions, in which a new carbon−heteroatom
bond is formed, are a commonly used approach in the synthesis
of heterocycles.8 Speciﬁcally, the intramolecular addition of a
nitrogen functionality to an alkyne or an alkene is a valuable
strategy.9 Herein, we report a synthetic methodology that
enables eﬃcient access to the construction of ﬁve- and six-
membered heterocyclic rings, such as pyrazoles and pyrazines,
via intramolecular ring closure reactions.

Aminopyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrazinium mesitylenesulfonate 3 was
reacted with dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate (DMAD) to
give the dihydro derivative 4, which was oxidized to 5 (Scheme

In this article, we ﬁrst illustrate the concept of cyclization of
pyrrole-derived α,β-alkynyl ketones
in the presence of
hydrazine monohydrate and a subsequent gold(III)-catalyzed
reaction11 to provide practical synthetic access to the design of
pyrazolo-pyrrolo-pyrazines 1.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub="scope">
First, we investigated the feasibility of the intended synthetic
approach to the target pyrazole scaﬀold by exploring the
reactivity of N-propargyl carboxylic acid 612 for the synthesis of
α,β-alkynyl ketones. Acid 6 was treated with thionyl chloride in
the presence of triethylamine in THF at room temperature.
The resulting acid chloride 7 was then condensed in situ with
the substituted trimethylsilyl acetylenes
to furnish the
corresponding α,β-acetylenic ketones 8 (Scheme 2).

<para sub="scope">
Although this work deals mainly with the synthesis of the
title compound, pyrazolo-pyrrolo-pyrazines 1, we reacted
compound 8a with AuCl3 in a mixture of MeOH/CH3CN at
room temperature and observed the formation of an eight-
membered heterocycle 9 in 77% yield after chromatographic
puriﬁcation (Scheme 3). The structure was assigned using 1D
and 2D NMR spectra (DEPT, COSY, HSQC, and HMBC). In
particular, the carbonyl carbon resonance at 191.1 ppm shows
strong correlation with oleﬁnic proton H-8 (6.71 ppm) as well

the other hand, the carbon resonance (C-6) at 155.2 ppm
correlates with double bond protons H-8 (6.71 ppm) and H-7
(5.52 ppm) and OCH3 protons resonating at 3.77 ppm.
Furthermore, proton H-8, resonating at 6.72 ppm as a doublet
of doublets, correlates with two oleﬁnic protons, H-9 and H-7,
appearing at 5.91 and 5.52 ppm as doublets (COSY spectrum).
All of these ﬁndings support the proposed structure 9.

The next step toward the substrate of the gold-catalyzed
cyclization was the synthesis of a library of dialkynyl ketones 10
with various substituents. The Sonogashira cross-coupling
reaction13 was used for the synthesis of the desired starting
materials.

As revealed in Scheme 4, several halo-substituted aromatic

Scheme 4. Synthesis of Substituted Dialkynes 10

After the generation of substituted dialkynes 10 via the
Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction, we turned our attention to
the synthesis of pyrazole derivatives 11. Knorr pyrazole
synthesis involving the condensation of a 1,3-dicarbonyl
compound with hydrazine is the most widely used method
for pyrazole skeleton construction.14 However, pyrazole
synthesis by the condensation of pyropargyl ketones with
hydrazines oﬀers some advantages.15 Even compounds with
very sensitive functionalities can be readily constructed by a
variety of acetylenic coupling reactions under very mild
conditions.16
<para sub="scope">
To our delight, N-propargyl α,β-alkynyl acetylenes 8a−c and
10a−e underwent a facile cyclization reaction with hydrazine,
thus giving access to pyrazole-substituted pyrroles 11a−h in
84−95% yields (Table 1).
Interestingly, we found that
hydrazine monohydrate reduces pyrazole 11a to 12 in the
presence of air without any catalyst or metal (Scheme 5). We
recently proposed that the oxygen dissolved in methanol was
responsible for partial oxidation of hydrazine to diimide, which
then reduced the triple and double bonds to the corresponding
alkanes in high yields (Scheme 5).17
</para>
We envisioned that

the metal-catalyzed intramolecular
cyclization reaction between pyrazoles and alkynes might
provide an entry to the facile synthesis of pyrazolo-pyrrolo-
pyrazine 1318 and pyrazolo-pyrrolo-diazepine 14 systems.
<para sub=“opt”>
Seven diﬀerent catalysts were tested (Table 2). Surprisingly,
no reaction was observed when the reaction was conducted
with CuOTf, an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complex of
Au(I), and PtCl2(PPh3)3 in acetonitrile (Table 2, entries 1−3).
Reactions with InCl3 and AgOTf gave trace amount of
cyclization product after 24 h (entries 4 and 5). However,
reactions with AuCl and AuCl3 catalysts gave endo-dig
cyclization product 14g after 3 h (entries 6 and 7) in yields
of 93 and 95%, respectively.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
After having obtained the optimal conditions for the Au-
catalyzed cyclization of 11g, we attempted to determine the
scope and limitation of
this transformation. To test our
strategy, we reacted pyrazoles 11a−c, having terminal alkynes,
with AuCl3 at room temperature to aﬀord pyrazolo-pyrrolo-
pyrazines 13a−c in good-to-excellent yields (Table 3, entries
1−3). The reaction proceeds via electrophilic activation of the
triple bond followed by 6-exo-dig heterocyclization and H-shift,
leading to pyrazolo-pyrrolo-pyrazine systems 13a−c. However,
the reaction of substituted alkynes 11d−h, under the same
reaction conditions, underwent smooth 7-endo-dig cycliza-
tion19,20 to produce 14d−h having a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrrolo-
[2,1-c][1,4]diazepine skeleton.21 The structures of cyclization
products 13 and 14 were determined by 1D and 2D NMR
(COSY, HSQC, and HMBC) spectra. The exact location of the
methylene group in 13g was established from the HMBC
spectrum, which showed a strong correlation between the
methylene carbon appearing at 34.5 ppm with two o-protons of
the benzene ring and a double bond proton in the pyrazine
ring, clearly indicating that methylene protons are located
between the double bond and the benzene ring. However, in
the case of 14g, the methylene carbon shows correlation with
the double bond proton as well as with the pyrrole proton,
clearly showing that the methylene group is directly attached to
the nitrogen atom of pyrrole.

</para>
<para sub="scope">
The formation of 7-endo-dig cyclization products 14d−h can
be explained by the initial activation of the alkyne unit with
gold cation, where the positive charge is closer to the aromatic
ring because of the better stabilization. The so-generated π-
complex undergoes intramolecular nucleophilic attack by the

On the basis of all the information obtained, we propose the
following gold-catalyzed cyclization reaction mechanism
(Scheme 6). The proposed catalytic cycle was initiated with
π-activation of the triple bond by AuCl3 to form intermediate
15, which triggers a gold-promoted intramolecular addition of
the NH group of pyrazole to the alkyne functionality to give
intermediates 16 and 17. The electronic nature of
the
substituents attached to the triple bond determines the mode
of the nucleophilic attack. In the next step, the gold species is
removed by a proton to give ﬁnal products 13 and 14.

After successful cyclization of pyrazole derivatives with
AuCl3, giving 7-endo-dig as well as 6-exo-dig products, we
turned our attention to intramolecular ring-cyclization reactions
of 11a−h with NaH. The reaction of 11a−h with NaH in N,N-
dimethylformamide (DMF) at
room temperature gave
exclusively 6-exo-dig heterocyclization products 13a−h. We
assume that the alkyne functionality ﬁrst undergoes a base-
catalyzed isomerization to give the corresponding allenes 18
(Figure 2).12 Since the central carbon atom in the allene moiety
is more electropositive, a nitrogen atom from the pyrazole ring
attacks exclusively this carbon atom, giving rise to the formation
of 6-exo-dig cyclization products 13 (Table 3).
</para>
<para sub="scope">
It was interesting to observe that 10f did not form the
expected pyrazole derivative 18 having acetylene units. The 13C
NMR spectrum of the product showed that the acetylene
carbon resonances were absent. The NMR spectra of the
isolated product were in agreement with the cyclization product
21 having an exo-methylene unit (Scheme 7). It is probable that
hydrazine acts as a base and isomerizes the alkyne unit in 19 to
the corresponding allene 20, which undergoes an intra-
molecular 6-exo-trig cyclization reaction to give the isolated
product 21.22 We assume that the pyridine ring, an electron-
deﬁcient aromatic ring, is responsible for isomerization of the
alkyne unit into the corresponding allene moiety. The NMR
spectra of 21 supported the proposed structure. The isomer-
ization of 21 into 22 was accomplished with DBU at room

■ CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a concise synthetic methodology for new
heterocyclic scaﬀolds, such as pyrazolo-pyrrolo-pyrazine skel-
eton 13 as well as pyrazolo-pyrrolo-diazepine skeleton 14. The
key features of this method include (i) synthesis of pyrrole-
derived α,β-alkynyl ketones, (ii) introduction of various
substituents into the alkyne functionality by Sonogashira
cross-coupling, (iii) synthesis of pyrazole units by the reaction
of α,β-alkynyl compounds with hydrazine monohydrate, (iv)
gold-catalyzed cyclization of pyrazoles with alkyne units, and
(v) cyclization with NaH. This synthetic strategy represents a
reasonable methodology for
the construction of hitherto
unknown skeletons, pyrazolo-pyrrolo-diazepine and pyrazolo-
pyrrolo-pyrazine, in high yield. Furthermore, this methodology
will allow us to introduce various substituents into all positions
of the target compound.

General Procedure for

Reaction of 11g with Diﬀerent Metal Catalysts. To a solution of
pyrazole 11g (0.5 mmol) in acetonitrile (10 mL) was added a solution
of metal catalysts (3% mol; see Table 2) in acetonitrile (1 mL)
dropwise at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The
reaction mixture was stirred for 3−24 h. The solvent was evaporated.
The residue was puriﬁed by a short silica gel column, eluting with ethyl
acetate/hexane. The residue was analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.
the Synthesis of Pyrazolo-pyrrolo-
pyrazines and Pyrazolo-pyrollo-diazepines via AuCl3-Catalyzed
Cyclization. To a solution of pyrazole 11 (0.4 mmol) in acetonitrile
(10 mL) was added a solution of gold trichloride (2.5 mmol %, 3 mg)
in acetonitrile (1 mL) dropwise at room temperature under a nitrogen
atmosphere. The reaction mixture was stirred for 8−24 h. The solvent
was evaporated. The residue was chromatographed on silica gel,
eluting with ethyl acetate/hexane to give pyrazolo-pyrrolo-pyrazines
and pyrazolo-pyrolo-diazepines 13 and 14.

General Procedure for

the Synthesis of Pyrazolo-pyrrolo-
pyrazines via NaH-Promoted Cyclization. To a solution of pyrazole
11 (0.4 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) was added sodium hydride (1.1
equiv) at room temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. The
reaction mixture was stirred for 10−15 min. After complete conversion
(monitored by TLC), water was added, and the mixture was extracted
with ethyl acetate (2 × 20 mL). The combined extracts were dried
over MgSO4 and evaporated. The crude product was chromato-
graphed on silica gel, eluting with ethyl acetate/hexane to give
pyrazolo-pyrrolo-pyrazines 13.

pyrazine (22). To a solution of 21 (119 mg, 0.37 mmol) in methylene
chloride (5 mL) was added 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU)
(100 μL, 0.7 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room
temperature for 0.5 h. After completion of the reaction (controlled by
TLC), water (5 mL) was added, and the solution was extracted with
methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts were dried over
MgSO4. The solvent was evaporated to give crude product, which was
puriﬁed by column chromatography over silica gel eluting with
