ABSTRACT: We have developed a general protocol
for the
interconversion of diverse protected boronic acids, via intermediate
organotriﬂuoroborates. N-Methyliminodiacetyl boronates, which
have been hitherto resistant to direct conversion to triﬂuoroborates,
have been shown to undergo ﬂuorolysis at elevated temperatures.
Subsequent solvolysis of organotriﬂuoroborates in the presence of trimethylsilyl chloride and a wide range of bis-nucleophiles
enables the generation of a variety of protected boronic acids.

■ INTRODUCTION

The utility of organoboron compounds in organic synthesis has
ﬂourished in recent years,1 particularly through developments
in the Suzuki−Miyaura coupling. Boronic acids are also
extremely valuable substrates
for other metal-catalyzed
reactions,2 the Petasis reaction,3 and the iterative synthesis of
polyene natural products.4,5a

Free boronic acids are often unstable, diﬃcult to handle, or
are prone to dehydration to give the corresponding
boroxine.1,4d Bulky boronate esters such as pinacolyl and
hexylene glycolyl boronate esters have been used extensively as
“blocking” groups that reduce the reactivity of the organo-
boronate through steric eﬀects.5b More recently,
true
“protecting” groups for boronic acids have been introduced
that modulate reactivity through both steric and electronic
eﬀects. Suginome and co-workers developed the diaminonaph-
thalenyl (dan) group that diminishes the reactivity of an
organoboron compound toward metal-catalyzed cross-cou-
plings.6 Burke and co-workers developed the N-methylimino-
diacetyl (mida) group as a boronic acid protecting group that
similarly renders the organoboron unreactive toward cross-
coupling reactions.4 Both the B(dan) and B(mida) protecting
groups require removal to regenerate the boronic acid to re-
establish reactivity of
the organoboron in cross-coupling
reactions.

To function as useful protecting groups,

the B(dan),
B(mida), and other boronate systems must be able to be
introduced and removed under mild conditions, preferably in
an orthogonal manner. The B(mida) and B(dan) protecting
groups employ orthogonal deprotection strategies, mild base4e
and acid,6c respectively. However, problems frequently arise in
the introduction of
these protecting groups, such as the
requirement of high temperatures and long reaction times,4c the
generation of highly reactive dibromoborane intermediates,4e
and low yields or conversion eﬃciency.

Organotriﬂuoroborate salts, extensively investigated by
Molander and co-workers,7 have also been used as protecting
groups for boronic acids. Organotriﬂuoroborates are generally
easily handled, stable crystalline solids. In the absence of protic
solvents, they have limited reactivity, though they are readily
hydrolyzed to the reactive boronic acid.8

We have previously shown that

triﬂuoroborates can be
hydrolyzed to the corresponding boronic acid with TMS-Cl in
the presence of water.9 We envisaged that elaboration of the
TMS-Cl promoted solvolysis of triﬂuoroborates, incorporating
various bis-nucleophiles in place of water, would enable the
generation of a variety of protected boronic acids. Together
with a general method for the generation of triﬂuoroborates
from protected boronic acid derivatives, this process would
enable the facile interconversion of virtually any combination of
boronic acid protecting groups. Such a process would allow the
protection of boronic acids under a wide range of reaction
conditions such that they could be carried through multistep
processes, a frequent limitation of the use of organoborons in
synthesis.4g

To establish the generality of this interconversion process, we
needed to establish the generality of both the preparation of
triﬂuoroborates from protected boronic acids and, subse-
quently,
the preparation of
protected boronic acids from triﬂuoroborates.

diaminoboranes15 to triﬂuoroborates and thus appears to be
quite general. However, no examples of the direct conversion of

N-based boron protecting groups, such as the important
B(mida) or B(dan) groups,
to triﬂuoroborates have been
reported. B(mida) groups have been converted to triﬂuor-
oborates
indirectly, via the corresponding boronic acid
intermediates.16 Several studies of compounds possessing a
B(dan) group and a second boronate group suggest that the
B(dan) group is resistant to conversion to triﬂuoroborates
under these conditions,17 but this has not been extensively
investigated. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether the
KHF2 method was suitable for the preparation of triﬂuor-
oborates from B(mida), B(dan), and other N-based boronate
derivatives.

readily achievable, we next sought to investigate the generality
of the complementary conversion of triﬂuoroborates to a range
of boronate derivatives.

We have previously developed a method for the hydrolysis of
triﬂuoroborates to boronic acids by treatment with TMSCl/
H2O.9 Molander et al. reported a closely related method
employing silica gel as the ﬂuorophile.19 While the conversion
of triﬂuoroborates to organoboron derivatives via the boronic
acid derivatives20 and dichloroboranes21 has been demon-
strated, the direct conversion of triﬂuoroborates to organo-
borons other than the boronic acid is rare and is limited to
elaboration of the TMS-Cl method with bis-silyl ethers22 or
esters.23 Molander has used silica gel in the presence of an
alcohol
to generate boronate esters from triﬂuoroborates,
though this transformation possibly proceeds via hydrolysis to
boronic acid followed by in situ boronate ester formation.19

Our initial investigations focused on the direct conversion of
triﬂuoroborates to boronate esters. Conversion of potassium
phenyltriﬂuoroborate 1a to the corresponding hexylene glycol
boronate 1f was initially optimized, with variation of
the
amount of diol and TMS-Cl and the type of base employed.
Reasonable yields were obtained under a variety of conditions,
with optimum yields for this transformation obtained with a
slight excess of diol and 3 equiv of both TMS-Cl and K2CO3
(Table 3). This direct method of conversion of triﬂuoroborates

Similarly, the aryl-B(pin)/B(mida) and aryl-B(pin)/B(dan) bis-
boronates, 24 and 20, respectively, also underwent selective
conversion of the B(pin) group to generate the corresponding

respectively (Scheme 1).
Pleasingly, conditions were also found that enabled selective
ﬂuorolysis of the B(aam) group in the B(aam)/B(mida) bis-
boronate 22, generating the aryl-BF3K/B(mida) bisboronate 23
in reasonable yield, despite the B(aam) group being only
slightly more reactive under ﬂuorolysis conditions than the
B(mida) group. Lastly, following conversion of the aryl-B(pin)/
B(mida) bis-boronate 24 to the corresponding monotriﬂuor-
oborate 23, subsequent treatment with TMS-Cl in the presence
of anthranilamide gave the corresponding B(aam)/B(mida) bis-

■ CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have developed a general protocol for the
interconversion of diverse protected boronic acids, via
intermediate organotriﬂuoroborates. B−N-containing boronate
derivatives are resistant to direct conversion to triﬂuoroborates,
though B(aam) and B(mida) compounds undergo the
conversion at elevated temperatures. Importantly, this allows
the selective conversion of diﬀerentially protected bisboronates
to monotriﬂuoroborates. Subsequent solvolysis of organo-
triﬂuoroborates in the presence of TMS-Cl and a wide range
of bis-nucleophiles allows the general conversion to a wide
variety of protected boronic acids.
