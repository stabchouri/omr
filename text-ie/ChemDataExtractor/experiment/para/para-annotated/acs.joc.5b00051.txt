ABSTRACT: Complete details of an asymmetric synthesis of
(+)-isatisine A (1) are described. The synthesis highlights the
use of a highly diastereoselective Mukaiyama-type [3 + 2]-
annulation of allylsilane 5 with the unsaturated aldehyde 9a to
assemble the functionalized tetrahydrofuran core of isatisine A.
A convergent route to the framework of the natural product
was established that employed a substrate-controlled indole
coupling that was followed by a late-stage intramolecular
copper(I)-mediated amidation to complete the assembly of the
tetracyclic framework of (+)-isatisine A. In addition, the scope
of the [3 + 2]-annulation was evaluated and enhanced utilizing diastereomeric allylsilanes anti-5 and syn-5 to establish an eﬃcient
route to stereochemically well-deﬁned tetrahydrofurans.

■ INTRODUCTION

Isatis indigotica Fort. (Cruciferae), which is a plant species
widely cultivated in China and East Asia, has been used as a
traditional medicine for treatment of viral diseases such as
inﬂuenza, viral pneumonia, mumps, and hepatitis. Further
investigations conducted by Chen and co-workers on I.
Indigotica to identify potent antiviral compounds resulted in
the isolation of isatisne A (1, Figure 1) along with 11 other

nonalkaoid species.1 Initially,
isatisine was isolated as an
acetonide derivative, which was most certainly generated during
the chromatographic puriﬁcation using acetone as an eluent.
However, its unusual dioxolane group that is rarely found in
natural products led to further investigation to unambiguously
assign the correct structure of the natural product. Biological
evaluation of acetonide derivative of isatisine revealed its potent
cytotoxicity against C8166 with CC50 = 302 μM and anti-HIV
activity of EC50 = 37.8 μM.

Isatisine A (1) is a unique fused-polycyclic alkaloid bearing
an indole ring system at
the C2 position, of which the
intriguing and challenging structure led to signiﬁcant attention
from the synthetic community. In 2010, Kerr and co-worker
reported the ﬁrst total synthesis of (+)-isatisine A and revision
of its absolute conﬁguration.2a,b This report was followed by
two total syntheses from the Panek2c and Liang2d groups,
respectively. Recently, Xie2e has disclosed a biomimetic total
synthesis of isatisine A, and shortly after, Ramana and co-
workers2f,g reported their eﬀorts culminating in the synthesis of
the natural product and its derivatives.

The present work diﬀers considerably from the previous
syntheses. For instance, Kerr and co-worker also reported a [3
+ 2] cycloaddition using a vinyl cyclopropane and an aldehyde
to generate the tetrahydrofuran core. However, the indole
addition to the intermediate aminal
to be
problematic, which led to a revised route to introduce the
indole branch through a cascade reaction sequence including
incorporation of
indole and lactamization to form the
tetracyclic framework of
isatisine at the late stage of their
synthesis. Additionally, the independent approaches, reported
by Xie and Ramana, respectively, demonstrated the use of the
“chiral pool” where protected forms of D-glucal and D-ribose
were used as the starting materials, respectively.

turned out

Herein, we disclose the full details of our eﬀorts toward the
total synthesis of (+)-isatisine A (1), including the development
of Mukaiyama-type [3 + 2]-annulation that led to the assembly
of the tetrahydrofuran core and the synthesis of 9-H-13-silyl-
substituted advanced intermediate 15.

■ RESULTS/DISCUSSION
Strategy and Methodology Development. Our interest
in isatisine originated from its unique tetracyclic ring system,
which bears a highly oxygenated tetrahydrofuran. As illustrated
in Scheme 1, our synthetic analysis of this alkaloid revealed

described.4 However,
the challenging heterocyclic core of
isatisine prompted us to develop a stereocontrolled method to
access
the functionalized tetrahydrofuran, which can be
subsequently converted to the isatisine core by straightforward
transformations.

During the course of a search of methods for tetrahydrofuran
synthesis, a Mukaiyama-type [3 + 2]-cycloaddition of a
carbamoyl enol ether with an aldehyde reported by Hoppe4j−m
particularly attracted our interest in these possibilities: (1)
cyclization is initiated by formation of an oxocarbenium
between the homoallylic hydroxyl group and an aldehyde
under acidic conditions; (2) the stereochemical course was
dictated by the conﬁguration of the allylic stereocenter. Taking
advantage of these points, we envisioned that alkoxy-substituted
allylsilane 5 bearing allylic C-centered chirality could direct the
stereochemical course of a Mukaiyama-type annulation to
provide a properly functionalized tetrahydrofruan 6 with useful
diastereoselectivity (Scheme 1).5
<para sub="scope">
The development of the [3 + 2]-annulation was initiated
with the preparation of the allylsilane nucleophiles anti-5 and
syn-5, starting from the known epoxysilanes6 cis-7 and trans-7,
respectively (Scheme 2). The annulation substrate anti-5 was
synthesized through epoxide opening reaction of cis-7 with
ethoxy ethynyllithium anion to aﬀord a propargyl silane anti-8
and subsequent Lindlar reduction of the alkyne to the (Z)-
oleﬁn.7 Although an epimerization of the secondary hydroxyl
group in anti-8, which arises from the stabilizing eﬀect of a
cation by the β-silicon eﬀect, is mechanistically possible, any
sign of the epimerization was not observed under the given
reaction conditions. Additionally, a prefect level of regiose-
lectivity in the epoxide opening reaction can be explained by
bond length diﬀerence between C−Si and C−C bond. Si−C
bond is ∼1.2 times longer than a normal C−C bond, which
may support the highly regioselective attack of a nucleophile at
the α-carbon from the silicon group.

In a similar manner,

syn-5 was also prepared through
trans-7 and subsequent

utilizing other Lewis acids, such as In(OTf)3 and Sc(OTf)3,
aﬀorded 6a in moderate yields (entries 2 and 3). The series of
reactions using Brønsted acids, such as trichloroacetic acid
(TCA), triﬂuoroacetic acid (TFA), and camphorsulfonic acid

The optimal conditions were found utilizing 1.0 equiv of PTSA
at 0 °C, which aﬀorded the desired product in 87% with a high
level of diastereoselectivity and within a short reaction time (ca.
10 min). As expected, the observed relative stereochemistry of
6a suggested that
the annulation proceeded through an
envelope-like transition state (Scheme 1, TS1), where a bulky
silane group is positioned at the pseudoequatorial orientation
and the enol ether is oriented in such a way as to minimize any
developing A1,3-allylic strain between the trialkysilane and
ethoxy group.

Having established optimal reaction conditions, a range of
aldehydes was evaluated to explore the scope of the [3 + 2]-

aliphatic aldehydes 9b−e were excellent reaction partners in the
annulations to aﬀord the trans,trans,cis-tetrahydrofurans 6b−e
in high yields and diastereoselectivities (Table 2). Additionally,
various aromatic aldehydes 9f−i, bearing an electron-donating
or -withdrawing substituent, were compatible under the deﬁned
reaction conditions aﬀording tetrahydrofurans 6f−i

aliphatic aldehydes 9b−e provided the desired product 10b−e

Total Synthesis of (+)-Isatisine A: First-Generation
Approach toward the Total Synthesis of (+)-Isatisine A.
Having an established synthesis of tetrahydrofuran 6a, which
bears the required stereochemical relationships and carbon
atoms for the fused-cyclic framework (C2−C14) of the natural
product, our remaining strategy relied on a series of oxidations
to furnish the correct oxidation states required for (+)-isatisine.
Therefore, our
retrosynthetic analysis began with
disconnection of C7a−N1 to aﬀord an intermediate secondary
amide 11. Further disconnection at the indole side chain C2−
C3′ led to an indole and key intermediate lactam 12, which
would be furnished through a series of oxidations of the
intermediate tetrahydrofuran 6a (Scheme 3).

■ CONCLUSION

We have developed a silicon-directed Mukaiyama-type [3 + 2]-
annulation to construct highly functionalized tetrahydrofurans.
This reaction displayed remarkable compatibility with a several
types of aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes and provided an
access to a wide range of functionalized tetrahydrofurans with
considerable structural and stereochemical variation. A total
synthesis of (+)-isatisine A (1) has been achieved starting from
the highly functionalized tetrahydrofuran 6a, which was
generated through this silicon-directed Mukaiyama-type [3 +
2]-annulation. Additionally, this synthesis represents another
application of a Buchwald-type amidation culminating the
assembly of the 3-indolone moiety of the complex natural
product. Further studies to synthesize naturally occurring
materials, which bear a complex tetrahydrofuran core, employ-
ing this annulation methodology are in progress and may be
reported at a later time.

by titration with menthol/2,2′-dipyridyl. All other reagents were used
as
toluene, diethyl ether, benzene,
tetrahydrofuran, and acetonitrile were obtained from an anhydrous
solvent system (alumina) and used without further drying. Unless
otherwise noted, reactions were magnetically stirred and monitored by
thin-layer chromatography with 0.20 mm silica gel 60 Å plates. Flash
chromatography was performed on 32−63 μm 60 Å silica gel. Yields
refer to chromatographically and spectroscopically pure compounds,
unless otherwise noted. 1H NMR spectra were taken in CDCl3,
methanol-d4, and CD3CN at 400 or 500 MHz (as indicated),
respectively. 13C NMR spectra were also taken in CDCl3, methanol-d4,
and CD3CN at 100 or 125 MHz (as indicated), respectively. Chemical
shifts are reported in parts per million relative to CDCl3 (1H, δ 7.24;
13C, δ 77.0), methanol-d6 (1H, δ 3.31; 13C, δ 49.0), and acetonitrile-d3

constant, integration. Diastereomeric ratios were determined by 1H
NMR (500 MHz) analysis of crude mixtures, operating at signal/noise
ratio of 200:1. Infrared resonance spectra were recorded as a thin ﬁlm

drofuran 6a (0.86 g, 1.87 mmol) in THF (18 mL) was added
phenyltrimethyl tribromide (1.0 g, 2.8 mmol) at rt. The solution was
allowed to stir for 12 h at rt before being cooled to 0 °C. TBAF (1 M
in THF, 1.87 mL, 1.87 mmol) was added dropwise, and the reaction
mixture was stirred for 10 min at 0 °C. Ethyl acetate (50 mL) and
water (10 mL) were added, and the layers were separated. The organic
layer was washed with H2O (3 × 10 mL), dried over magnesium
sulfate, ﬁltered, and concentrated in vacuo (temperature of water bath
must keep below 30 °C) to obtain an unsaturated aldehyde as a
yellowish oil. Since this intermediate aldehyde was unstable under

(20) The low yield in this cascade-like process was mainly attributed
to the low eﬃciency in the dihydroxylation of the styrene-like oleﬁn of
18. In the stepwise dihydroxylation−protection sequence (Schemes 7
and 8), aminal 19 was prepared through seven steps in 23.8% yield.

(22) The discrepancy between the experimental optical rotation and
the literature value is attributed to the moderate level of enantiomeric
purity of epoxide cis-7 (up to 92% ee).
