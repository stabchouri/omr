ABSTRACT: Naphthalene-bridged bis-triazole (NBT) com-
plexes were prepared and characterized for investigation of
their photophysical properties. Unlike our previously reported
N-2-aryl triazoles, which gave strong emissions through the
planar intramolecular charge transfer mechanism (coplanar
conformation), this newly developed NBT adopted a non-
coplanar conformation between triazole and naphthalene,
achieving ﬂuorescence through twisted intramolecular charge
transfer.

S mall organic molecules that can provide strong ﬂuores-

cence emissions are of great importance to the scientiﬁc
community.1 These molecular ﬂuorophores have been applied
to a wide range of research areas, including chemistry, biology,
and material science.2 In 2011, our group reported N-2-aryl-
1,2,3-triazoles (NAT) as novel ﬂuorophores with strong
emission in the high-energy UV/blue region.3 The exper-
imental results (X-ray structures) and computational studies
conﬁrmed the coplanar conformation (observed in N-2
isomers, Scheme 1A) as the key factor
for ﬂuorescence

Scheme 1. N-2-Aryl Triazole Fluorophores

(Scheme 1B), suggesting twisted intramolecular charge transfer
(TICT) is a plausible mechanism for the observed strong
ﬂuorescence emission.4

We have previously reported that N-2-aryl triazole 1a gave
very strong ﬂuorescence emission, whereas its N-1 isomer 1b
gave no emission at all. Two key factors appeared to control the
ﬂuorescence emission in these NAT dyes: N-2 substitution and
coplanar conformation between the two rings. However, the
second assumption was greatly challenged by our recent studies
of N-naphthalene triazoles. As shown in Figure 1, we recently
prepared N-naphthalene triazole 1c (N-2 isomer) and 1d (N-1

emission. On the basis of these studies, planar intramolecular
charge transfer (PICT) was proposed as a plausible mechanism
for the observed excellent optical properties of this novel NAT
system. Herein, we report
the design and synthesis of
naphthalene-bridged bis-triazole (NBT) compounds, which
give excellent ﬂuorescence emissions, even with a twisted
conformation between triazole and the N-2 aryl groups

the
synthesis of NBT was how to identify the relative position of
the two triazole rings with restricted rotation. Considering the
rotation of C−N bonds, theoretically two conformers (cis and
trans) could be formed. Interestingly, during our synthesis, only
one conformer was observed in almost all cases, which was later
conﬁrmed as the cis-conformer via X-ray crystallography
(Figure 3).

structure of mono-triazole-substituted 4a (Ar1 = Ph, with I on
naphthalene ring) was also obtained (see the Supporting
Information (SI)). Similarly, according to this crystal structure,
the dihedral angle between these two rings is 62.9°. With all of

isomer). Similar to phenyl triazoles, N-1 isomer 1d gave no
ﬂuorescence emission, and the N-2 isomer 1c gave strong
emission. However, a closer look at 1c suggests that coplanar
conformation between naphthalene and the triazole ring is
highly unlikely due to steric repulsion. In fact, the crystal
structure of a similar analogue indicated a 49.5° dihedral angle
between the two rings in the N-2 isomer.5 These results piqued
our interest in further exploring this new class of dyes by
questioning whether the coplanar conformation is necessary.6
Besides coplanar intramolecular charge transfer (PICT),
another feasible photochemical process associated with this
type of extended aromatic ring, twisted intramolecular charge
transfer (TICT), was ﬁrst introduced by Grabowski and co-
workers.7 One important feature of the TICT type of emission
is the feasibility of the donor unit in initiating the charge
transfer. A number of nitrogen-containing heterocycles have
been studied as donors in TICT-emitting molecules.8 However,
to the best of our knowledge, 1,2,3-triazoles have never been
used as a potential donor in TICT ﬂuorophores, and their
photochemical properties are unknown.

formation of

To explore triazole derivatives as potential TICT-emitting
dyes, we prepared anthracene-substituted triazole 1e (N-2) and
1f (N-1). Clearly, the anthracene should provide a large enough
the coplanar
steric repulsion to prevent
conformation even in the N-2 isomer 1e. Thus,
the
ﬂuorescence emission should be mainly from the twisted
state. Interestingly, both N-1 and N-2 isomers gave good
emissions. However,
three diﬀerent emission bands were
observed in N-1 isomer 1f, which was similar to the typical
emission of aromatic-substituted anthracene.9 This result
suggested that triazole-anthracene compounds were not good
model molecules to access the triazole’s inﬂuence on TICT
emission due to the notable background emission from
anthracene. To better evaluate the triazole inﬂuence in the
twisted systems, we designed naphthalene-bridged bis-triazole
(NBT).

to reach NBT, either in a one-pot fashion (condition A) or a
stepwise process (condition B).5 Using these methods, both
symmetrical NBT 3 and unsymmetrical NBT 5 could be easily
prepared. Notably, both N-1 and N-2 isomers were observed in
all cases. The regioselectivity (ratio between N-2 and N-1
isomers) depends on the substituted groups (Ar) similar to
what has been observed previously in triazole functionaliza-
tion.10 The N-1 and N-2 isomers could be easily separated

As shown by the crystal structures, both bis-triazole NBT 3
and mono-triazole 4 adopted a twisted conformation. However,
whereas N-2 isomers generally gave good ﬂuorescence
emission, the N-1 isomers gave almost no emission in all
cases. The emission intensity of NBT 3 followed a clear trend
in that N2−N2 > N2−N1 > N1−N1 (almost no emission).
Because of the rotation strain, it is impossible for NBT 3 to
adopt planar conformation even in solution. Thus, the observed
good ﬂuorescence emission of the N-2 isomers likely represents
the photochemical process associated with TICT states. The
optical properties (emission, excitation, and quantum yields) of
compounds 3 and 4 were determined and summarized in Table
1.

it is reasonable to expect that the
substituted groups on the triazole phenyl ring may provide
various electronic eﬀects that will inﬂuence the overall optical
properties.3,12 To explore the substituted group inﬂuence, we

In conclusion, we report a new type of

triazole-based
ﬂuorescence-active compound: naphthalene-bridged bis-triazole
(NBT). Practical syntheses have been developed, and regio-
isomers of compounds have been characterized by X-ray
crystallography. The ﬂuorescence studies reveal that in this
twisted system, N-2 substitution is crucial
for ﬂuorescence
emission. Compared to the previously reported NAT system,
this new NBT gives higher ﬂuorescence eﬃciency and larger
Stokes shifts, which warrants the new molecule as a potential
ﬂuorophore for chemical and biological applications.

Among all the tested NBTs, N-2 substitution is crucial for
eﬀective emission. Compared with previous planar NAT 1a, the
new twisted NBT ﬂuorophores give more red shifted emissions
around 400 nm (blue light). Interestingly, although the two
triazole rings are almost parallel, changing the substituent
groups on the phenyl rings did not
inﬂuence the overall
emission of the NBT. For example, with either EDG (5b)- or
EWG (5c and 5d)-substituted NBT, there were little changes in
the emission and excitation wavelengths. Furthermore,
substrate 5e, with EDG and EWG incorporated on diﬀerent
rings, also gave similar emission, which strongly suggested that
little π-π interactions occurred between the two rings. Notably,
the substituent group did help to improve the quantum yields

UV Absorption Spectra. The UV−Vis spectra were measured in
10.00 mm quartz cells. All samples were measured as 10−6 mol/L
solutions of bis-N-2-aryl triazole in CH2Cl2. The wavelength range is
between 200 and 600 nm.

Fluorescence Excitation and Emission Spectra. Fluorescence
emission and excitation spectra were measured in 10.00 mm quartz
cells. All samples were measured as 10−6 mol/L solutions of bis-N-2-
aryl triazole in CH2Cl2. The emission spectra were obtained with an
excitation wavelength around 300 to 310 nm, and the excitation
spectra were obtained with emission λ
max according to diﬀerent
compounds.
Quantum Yields. Quantum yields were calculated using the
standard 9,10-diphenylanthracene, which excited at 340 nm (Φ = 0.9)

in cyclohexane. Quantum yields were calculated using the following
equation, where Φ is the quantum yield, Int is the area of the emission
peak, A represents absorbance at the excitation wavelength, and n is
the reﬂective index of the solvent. The subscript reference is the
respective values of
the standard 9,10-diphenylanthracene. The
absorptions of bis-N-2-aryl
triazole and 9,10-diphenylanthracene
were <0.05 (concentrations = 10−6 mol/L).
