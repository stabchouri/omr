ABSTRACT: Aminobenzofuran-fused rhodamine dyes (AFR
dyes) containing an amino group were constructed by an
eﬃcient condensation based on 3-coumaranone derivatives.
AFR dyes exhibited signiﬁcantly improved properties, including
deep-red and near-infrared emissions, a large Stokes shift, good
photostability, and wide pH stability. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-
yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium assay experiments show that
these AFR dyes are biocompatible for their low cytotoxicity to
both A549 and HeLa cells. Cell imaging data reveal that AFR1,
AFR1E, and AFR2 are mainly located in the mitochondria,
while AFR3 is a lysosome tracker. As far as we know, NIR AFR3 is the longest ﬂuorescent rhodamine derivative containing the
amino group. These amino group-containing AFR dyes hold great potential in ﬂuorogenic detection, biomolecule labeling, and
cell imaging.

■ INTRODUCTION

such as high molar extinction coeﬃcients,

rhodamine
Compared with other generally used dyes,
derivatives have received considerable attention in biomolecule
labeling and detection, cancer diagnosis, and other biological
applications because of their outstanding photophysical proper-
ties,
large
ﬂuorescence quantum yields, and resistance to photobleaching.1
In addition, chemical modiﬁcation of rhodamine dyes is a
straightforward process.2 For example, modiﬁcation of
the
amino group on the ring of the rhodamine moieties is usually
utilized to detect cancer-related markers or
signiﬁcant
biomolecules in living samples.3 However, most rhodamine
derivatives emit green to orange ﬂuorescence. As we know, in
contrast to short wavelength ﬂuorophores, deep-red and near-
infrared (NIR) dyes is advantageous to biodetection or imaging
because of the minimal photodamage to biological samples,
deep tissue penetration, and minimal
interference from
background autoﬂuorescence in living systems.4

Substantial eﬀorts have been made to synthesize rhodamine
derivatives with longer emission wavelengths. The innovative
work of replacing the bridged oxygen atom with other elements
(Si, Ge, Sn, or Te) was proposed by Qian and Nagano et al.5
An amino group-containing rhodamine dye with red emission
(2Me SiR600; λ
max = 613 nm) was obtained by the Nagano
group.6 In addition, Abe’s group synthesized a deep-red
naphthyl-fused rhodamine derivative with an amino group
(λ
max = 650 nm).7 After that, a series of deep-red to NIR
rhodamine derivatives were developed by extending the π-
conjugation of
the rhodamine skeleton by benzene or

heteroaromatic rings.8 Aside from the strategies mentioned
above, introducing electron-withdrawing groups (CF3 and CN)
into the rhodamine skeleton at position 9 can also be utilized to
increase the ﬂuorescence wavelength of rhodamine dyes.9 Just
recently, another
strategy was explored to obtain NIR
rhodamine analogues by introducing phenylethynyl at position
9.10 However, these strategies have some drawbacks, such as
low production yield,
tedious and rigorous synthesis, pH
sensitivity, and a small Stokes shift.

Aromatic ring-fused dyes have high ﬂuorescence quantum
yields, good photostability, and longer emission wavelengths.11
However, very few aromatic ring-fused rhodamine derivatives
have been constructed, especially heteroaromatic rings.7,8
Recently, our group synthesized a series of coumarin-fused
rhodamine dyes (CR series) as a novel ratiometric detection
platform, which exhibited deep-red emission, good ﬂuorescence
quantum yields, excellent photostability and low cytotoxity.8b
In the study presented here, we design and synthesize another
novel
family of deep-red and NIR rhodamine derivatives
(AFR1, AFR1E, AFR2, and AFR3) bearing an amino group by
introducing benzofuran into the rhodamine skeleton (Scheme
1). These novel aminobenzofuran-fused rhodamine dyes have
the advantage of a larger Stokes
longer emission
wavelengths, and higher pH stability compared to those of
the traditional rhodamine dyes. Cell cytotoxicity experiments
reveal that these AFR dyes are biocompatible with both A549

dyes and the amino group contained in the rhodamine skeleton
identify them as promising candidates for imaging-related
biological applications.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub="scope">
Design and Synthesis. The synthetic routes of the AFR
dyes are outlined in Scheme 1. The key intermediate 3 was
prepared using a previously published method.12 First, the
starting material 1 was protected by the acetyl group to obtain
2. 2-Chloroacetyl chloride was the introduced into compound 2
via the Friedel−Crafts reaction. After cyclization reaction with
AcONa in ethanol, the synthetic precursor 3 was obtained.
Condensation of 3 and 7 in the presence of heated
concentrated H2SO4 leads to AFR1 with an excellent yield
(90%), during which the acetyl group was automatically
removed without further treatment. Likewise, AFR2 was also
synthesized by condensation of 3 and 8 with a high yield
(69%). AFR1E was obtained from AFR1 in ethanol catalyzed
by concentrated H2SO4.

<para sub="scope">
The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups such as
CF3 at position 9 of xanthenes leads to dyes with longer
absorption and emission wavelengths.9 The CF3 group is
introduced into the xanthene skeleton usually through a
reaction between 3-alkylaminophenol and triﬂuoroacetic
anhydride (TFAA). However, the production yield is low,
and further conjugation is restricted because of the absence of
functional groups.9 Recently, Cornish proposed a new strategy
by using the reaction of TFAA with a diaryl ether derivative
with good yield.13 Thus, a similar synthetic method was
employed to synthesize AFR3 by the reaction of 3 and 6 with a
yield of 11%. The intermediate 6 was synthesized in three steps
from the starting material 4. Compound 5 that was prepared by
acetylation of 4 reacted with TFAA via the Friedel−Crafts
reaction and then was deacetylated by HCl in THF leading to

corresponding spectra are shown in Figure 1 and Figures S1
and S2 of the Supporting Information. The maximal emission
wavelengths (λ
max) of AFR1, AFR1E, and AFR2 gradually
increased from CH2Cl2 to EtOH to H2O, which indicates the
phenomenon of positive solvatochromism. Likewise, AFR3
showed the same changing trend for emission in these solvents.
As expected, AFR3 emits NIR ﬂuorescence because of the
introduction of the electron-withdrawing group (CF3) into the
skeleton leading to a lower energy gap.9 AFR3 is the longest
ﬂuorescent rhodamine derivative containing an amino group.

absorption intensity varied very little in the pH range of 2−9.
AFR3 had strong absorption intensity only under acidic
conditions (from 2.0 to 6.0), but
the intensity dropped
between pH 6 and 11. Under alkaline environment conditions,
the position directly connected with CF3 of AFR3 might be
easily attached by hydroxyl, resulting in structural destruction.
Nonetheless, it had little inﬂuence on the bioimaging properties
of AFR3 because of
the location in the acid organelle

For
diﬀerent solvents, no distinct regularity was observed except in
the visible light and deep-red region (Figure 1). AFR3 may be
an excellent imaging dye because of excitation at the deep-red
wavelength (640 nm), which largely reduced the level of
photodamage and autoﬂuorescence in living samples. The
molar extinction coeﬃcients of the AFR dyes ranged from
70000 to 134000 M−1 cm−1, whereas few were in the region
from 13000 to 45000 M−1 cm−1. Compared with traditional
rhodamine dyes,7,16 the AFR dyes had larger Stokes shifts (>50
nm) in H2O, which could reduce the level of self-absorption,
help produce a high resolution, and facilitate multichannel
bioimaging.4b,17

The pH stability of the AFR dyes was measured in diﬀerent
Britton-Robinson (BR) buﬀers (40 mM, pH 2−11). As seen in
Figure 2 and Figure S3 of the Supporting Information, the
absorption intensity of AFR1 remains almost the same over a
wide pH range (4.0−10.0). This result indicates wider pH
stability for AFR1 than for traditional rhodamine dyes,7 which
implies that the formation of spirolactone for AFR1 is diﬃcult
probably because of
the introduction of aminobenzofuran.

permeating the living cells at the optimal concentration, and
obvious stains in the cytoplasm were observed. Generally,
positively charged rhodamine derivatives are mainly located in
the mitochondria by electrostatic interactions.7b,19 Hence,
MitoTracker Green FM (MTG) as the standard mitochondria
marker was ﬁrst used to conﬁrm the localization of AFR dyes in
the A549 cells. AFR1, AFR1E, and AFR2 are mainly located in
the mitochondria with 90−99% overlap with MTG (Figure 3a).
As for AFR3, it had little overlap with MTG in A549 cells (data
not shown), which properly stained lysosome. The colocaliza-
tion experiment of AFR3 with LysoTracker Green (LTG, a
commercially available lysosome speciﬁc staining probe)
demonstrated that ﬂuorescence throughout the cytoplasm is
predominantly associated with lysosomes (Figure 3b).

Photostability and Cytotoxicity. It is vital to note that

decreased to 95%, whereas those of AFR1E and AFR2

located in the mitochondria, and AFR3 is a lysosome tracker.
Our work demonstrated an alternative strategy for obtaining a
high quantum yield, a large Stokes shift, and long wavelength
ﬂuorescent dyes. Further studies using the AFR dyes for
detection and imaging applications in biological samples are
underway in our laboratory.

intensity remained after irradiation for 20 min, which was
roughly equal to that of LTG. The results mentioned above

exhibited very low cytotoxicity after incubation in A549 cells for

concentration, the cell viabilities of AFR dyes were >85%. The
results of the MTT assay in HeLa cells (Figure S5 of the

results for A549 cells. These results indicate that the AFR dyes

and good biocompatibility were synthesized. AFR1, AFR1E,
and AFR2 show deep-red emission, high ﬂuorescence quantum

Imaging. A human non-small cell lung cancer cell line (A549 cells)
was used to perform all the imaging-related experiments (including the
MTT assay), while a human uterine cervical cancer cell line (HeLa
cells) was used only to evaluate the cytotoxicity of AFR dyes by the
MTT assay. A549 and HeLa cells were cultured in confocal dishes in
culture media [McCoy’s 5A and Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS), 50 units/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin] under a
5% CO2/air atmosphere at 37 °C in a humidiﬁed incubator for 24 h.
Then 2 or 5 μL of the AFR dye solution (stock solution, 1 mM in
DMSO) was added to the culture medium of A549 cells and incubated
at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 30 min before being imaged. (For
colocalization experiments, A549 cells were treated and incubated with
100 nM MTG or 200 nM LTG.) Cells were washed with PBS (pH
7.4) three times before being imaged. Images were aquired with a
Nikon C1si laser scanning confocal microscope (excitation at 488 nm,
FITC channel; excitation at 543 nm, TRITC channel; excitation at 640
nm, DAPI channel) and processed with NIS-Elements Viewer 3.20.
For photostability, AFR1, AFR1E, AFR2, MTG, and LTG were
continuously irradiated with a 488 nm laser, and a 640 nm laser was
used for AFR3.

MTT Assay. AFR dye stock solutions (1 mM each) were diluted
with fresh medium (McCoy’s 5A and DMEM were utilized for A549
and HeLa cells, respectively) to diﬀerent concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8,
and 10 μM). A549 or HeLa cells were cultured in a 96-well plate for 12
h, and then the cell medium was exchanged with diﬀerent
concentrations of AFR solutions, which were removed after incubation
for 2 h and exchanged with fresh medium. After a 24 h incubation at
37 °C in 5% CO2, the cell medium were exchanged with fresh medium
(100 μL), and then 20 μL of the MTT (5 mg/mL) solution was added
to each well. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h, 100 μL of
DMSO was added after the culture medium had been discarded. The
absorbance for all the wells with cell medium was measured at 570 nm,
and the cell viability of untreated cells was set to 100% as a reference.

lished method was followed to synthesize compound 2.22 Acetic

Synthesis of AFR1. Compound 3 (382 mg, 2.0 mmol) and
compound 7 (640 mg, 2.0 mmol) were successively added to
concentrated H2SO4 (10 mL), which was heated at 100 °C for 4 h.
After being cooled, the mixture was poured into ice−water, and then
perchloric acid (2 mL) was added. The resulting precipitate was
ﬁltered oﬀ and washed with plenty of water. After the sample had
dried, puriﬁcation by silica gel chromatography using a CH2Cl2/
CH3OH mixture [20:1, 10:1, 5:1, or 3:1 (v/v)] as the eluent gave
AFR1 as a dark-blue solid (945 mg, 90%). Mp: 292−294 °C. 1H NMR

Synthesis of AFR1E. Concentrated H2SO4 (2 mL) was added to
an ethanol solution (10 mL) of compound AFR1 (527 mg, 1.0 mmol),
and the solution was heated to reﬂux for 4 h. After the sample had
cooled, ethanol was removed under reduced pressure and the residue
was slowly diluted with 50 mL of H2O followed by 2 mL of HClO4,
which was stirred to collect the resulting precipitate. After the sample
had dried, puriﬁcation by silica gel chromatography using a CH2Cl2/
CH3OH [100:1, 80:1, or 60:1 (v/v)] as the eluent gave AFR1E as a
