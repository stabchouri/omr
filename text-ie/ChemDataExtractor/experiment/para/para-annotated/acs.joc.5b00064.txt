ABSTRACT: A convergent strategy was developed for the stereoselective synthesis of four unusual N-acylated monosaccharides
(5−8), which are fragments of lipooligosaccharide IV (LOS-IV) from Mycobacterium marinum. A critical substrate-controlled
asymmetric cyclization of an amino acid derived oxazolidine provided a key lactam intermediate 11, which was successfully
converted to targets 5−7. The key step in the synthesis of 8 was a one-pot cascade oxidation−cyclization−oxidation reaction of a
Boc-protected amino alcohol, prepared from 3-butynol, which led to the formation of lactam 15. The ﬁve-membered ring lactam
intermediates in these synthetic routes were sensitive to elimination side reactions, but careful manipulation of the reaction
sequence allowed for the stereoselective synthesis of the targets. This work represents the ﬁrst synthesis of these unusual motifs,
which have been shown to be essential to the bioactivity of LOS-IV.

■ INTRODUCTION

Lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) are antigenic cell surface glyco-
lipids found in the cell wall complex of mycobacteria.1 They are
produced by a range of mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium
smegmatis,3 M. gastri,4−6 M. malmoense,7 M.
kansasii,2 M.
marinum,8−10 and the Canetti strain of M. tuberculosis.11 Recent
investigations12 support a role for LOSs in important biological
events,
including sliding motility, bioﬁlm formation, and
infection of host macrophages; however, their precise role in
mycobacterial virulence remains unclear.13
M. marinum produces four LOSs (LOS-I−IV, Figure 1).
Similar to all LOSs reported to date, these molecules contain an
acylated trehalose core, which is functionalized with a species-
speciﬁc glycan. The glycan in M. marinum LOS-IV is
terminated with a family of N-acylated 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-
galactopyranose residues.10 These unusual N-acylated mono-
saccharides share a common lactam core, diﬀerentiated by
substitutions at C-2 (CO2H or H) or C-4 (MeO or H). This
heterogeneity generates two acidic (1 and 2, Figure 2) and two
neutral (3 and 4) compounds. Compounds 1 and 2, substituted
by both carboxy (C-2) and methoxy (C-4) groups, account for
95% of the total LOS-IV derivatives.10 The absolute stereo-
chemistry of the substituents in the lactam ring of 1−3 have
been determined using 1H NMR spectroscopy,
in particular
through NOE experiments. However, this was not possible for
4, and it was proposed that its lactam structure was either that
shown in Figure 2 or its enantiomer.
Recent studies by Guérardel and co-workers showed that
LOS-IV induces the expression of both Intercellular Adhesion
Molecule 1(ICAM-1) and CD40 on macrophages. In addition,
LOS-IV stimulates Interleukin-8 (IL-8) secretion from THP-1

cells. However, LOS-III did not show these activities,10 thus
indicating that
these terminal N-acylated monosaccharides
confer important biological functions to LOS-IV. The biological
activity of these motifs,
in conjunction with their intriguing
structure, motivated us to develop a synthetic route that would
provide these compounds in a form that could be used for
future investigations of their function. In this paper, we describe
the ﬁrst stereoselective synthesis of these unusual N-acylated
monosaccharides (5−8). These molecules were synthesized
bearing an aminooctyl aglycone, a group that provides a
convenient handle for conjugation, for example, to proteins for
the generation of monoclonal antibodies.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub=“ques”>
The targets feature a structure consisting of a highly substituted
γ-lactam connected through an amide bond to a 4-amino-4,6-
dideoxy-α-D-galactopyranoside moiety. Retrosynthetic analysis
of 5−8 is outlined in Scheme 1. The disconnection of the
amide bond in 5−7 aﬀords protected 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-
galactose derivative 9 and three γ-lactams, which could be
accessed from the same key intermediate 10. Compound 10
could be produced from the fused bicyclic oxazolidine−
pyrrolinone 11 through a series of
functional group trans-
formations. In turn, 11 could be accessed by stereoselective
cyclization of 12, which is accessible from D-serine (13). With
regard to the synthesis of 8, disconnection of the amide bond
leads to amine 9 and N-methyl lactam 14. Following a series of
functional group manipulations, Boc-protected lactam 15 could

reduction by the Staudinger reaction and triﬂuoroacetylation of
the resulting amine gave the corresponding triﬂuoroacetamide
derivative 23 in 79% yield over the two steps. The anomeric
allyl group in 23 was then removed by treatment with a
catalytic amount of PdCl2 in a solution of methanol and
CH2Cl2 to aﬀord the hemiacetal, which, upon exposure to
trichloroacetonitrile, Cs2CO3, and 4 Å molecular sieves in
anhydrous CH2Cl2, gave the desired trichloroacetimidate
donor. Glycosylation of the trichloroacetimidate donor with
8-azido-octanol in the presence of TMSOTf was α-selective,
aﬀording 24 in 68% overall yield from 23. Finally,
the

conditions to aﬀord 8-azidooctyl 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-galacto-
pyranoside (9) in 96% yield.

Synthesis of Key Lactam Precursor 11. After

the
successful synthesis of 9, we turned our attention to the
preparation of the protected lactam derivative 11. The key issue
was to introduce stereocenters at α and β positions of the
lactam. In previous work, Ling and co-workers (Scheme 3)16
treated α-alkyl-β-keto amide 25 with DBU at 110 °C, which led
to a cyclization−dehydration sequence forming α,β-unsaturated
lactam 27.
</para>

<para sub="scope">
Inspired by this reaction, we hypothesized that, if α-methoxy-
β-keto amide 12 (Scheme 4) was reacted with DBU, a product
with the hydroxyl group cis to ester would be formed because of
H-bonding with the carbonyl group. In addition, we anticipated
that the methoxy group would be trans to the hydroxy group
due to a dipole eﬀect. With this plan in mind, we started our
synthetic work from D-serine methylester hydrochloride (13).
This α-amino ester was condensed with pivaldehyde to aﬀord
an oxazolidine intermediate that was directly coupled with
acetoacetic acid in the presence of EDC and DMAP, giving β-
keto amide 28 in 77% overall yield. Iodosobenzenediacetate-
mediated oxidation of 28 in methanol provided the α-methoxy-
β-keto amide 12 in 90% yield. DBU-promoted cyclization of 12
was carried out as reported by Ling and co-workers; however,

in our hands, it was necessary to use a lower temperature (60
°C) to avoid the dehydration following cyclization. After 12 h,
two diastereomeric cyclized products were formed (ratio 9:1
from the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude product), which
could be separated by chromatography. Pleasingly, NOESY
experiments (see the Supporting Information) showed that the
major product (70% isolated yield) was
the desired
intermediate 11 and the minor product (8% isolated yield)
was the undesired stereoisomer (29) where the hydroxyl and
methoxy groups are cis. X-ray crystallographic analysis of 11
further conﬁrmed the structure of the major product (see
Figure S1 and Tables S1 and S2 in the Supporting
Information).
</para>
<para sub=“opt”>
The next step was to protect the tertiary alcohol in 11 as a
benzyl ether. Mindful of the anticipated base-sensitivity of 11,
initial attempts to benzylate this tertiary alcohol were carried
out under acidic conditions (TMSOTf and benzyl trichlor-
oacetimidate). However, these attempts were unsuccessful, and
so we turned our attention to base-promoted alkylation.
Treatment of alcohol 11 with NaH and benzyl bromide (2
equiv) led to the formation of two benzylated compounds
(ratio 24:71) and a trace amount of elimination byproduct 35
(Table 1). Disappointingly, NOESY experiments (see the
Supporting Information) conﬁrmed that the major product was
34, in which the substituents α and β to carbonyl group were
cis. Presumably, upon deprotonation of alcohol with base, the
resulting anion undergoes a reversible retro-aldol reaction
(Scheme 5).17 Although, upon recyclization, both stereo-
isomers can be formed in this process, the cis intermediate
32 would be expected to react faster with benzyl bromide given
dipolar eﬀects, leading to a majority of 34. We imagined that
using a higher concentration of benzyl bromide would allow the
trapping of alkoxide 30 before ring opening. Gratifyingly, as
outlined in Table 1, increasing the ratio of BnBr to DMF to 1:2,
led to a 3:2 ratio of the desired (33) to undesired (34)
stereoisomers. Further increasing the ratio of BnBr to DMF to
3:1 and decreasing the temperature to −15 °C gave a 9:1
mixture of 33 and 34.

Synthesis of Target 5. After the successful alkylation of the
tertiary alcohol, a series of
functional group manipulations
converted 33 into the key intermediate 10 (Scheme 6). Acidic
conditions were used to cleave the oxazolidine ring in 81%
yield. The primary alcohol product of this reaction, 36, was
then converted to TBS ether 37 and then N-methyl amide 38
in 83% yield over the two steps. Finally, n-Bu4NF deprotection
of the TBS ether provided 10 in 89% yield. With 10 in hand,

When 5, which was homogeneous based on HRMS analysis,
was dissolved in CD3OD, the 1H NMR spectrum showed a
mixture of two species in a 4:3 ratio. When the solvent was
changed to DMSO-d6, the ratio for these two isomers was still
4:3; however, it changed to 10:1 after 2 days. Finally, when
AcOH-d4 was used as solvent, the ratio changed to 2:3 after 1
day and did not change further (see the Supporting
Information). Recovery of the samples dissolved in DMSO-d6
and AcOH-d4 and redissolution in CD3OD resulted in a 4:3
mixture of isomers. These experiments suggest that, following
deprotection, N-acylated monosaccharide 5 exists as a mixture
of two atropisomers about the C-4 amide bond, with solvent-
dependent populations. Attempts to resolve the atropisomers
into a single species using elevated temperature (60 °C) NMR
experiments in CD3OD did not result in signiﬁcant changes in

presumably due to steric eﬀects arising from the TBS protecting

Thus, we decided to hydrolyze the key intermediate 10, which
possesses a free hydroxyl group (Scheme 8). Compound 10
was easily hydrolyzed by treatment with LiOH in THF and
water at room temperature to aﬀord acid 44 in 92% yield.
TBTU-promoted amidation of 44 with amine 9 led to a 67%

Pinnick oxidation straightforwardly aﬀorded acid precursor 47

therefore, carried forward as a
mixture. Hydroylsis of 48 by treatment with LiOH in THF and
water aﬀorded the corresponding carboxylic acids 49 (also as an
inseparable mixture of diastereomers), which were coupled with
amine 9. The resulting two amidation products, 50 and 51,
were separated by column chromatography to give major and
minor products in a 4:1 ratio. NOESY experiments (see the

the CH3 (δ1.52 ppm) and H-2′(δ3.90 ppm) in the major
product was stronger than the interaction between the CH3
(δ1.38 ppm) and H-2′ (δ4.03 ppm) in the minor product.
These results suggest that 50, with a cis relationship between
the benzyl ether and amide groups, was formed as the major
product (64% yield calculated based on amine 9). Compound
51 was formed as a minor product in 16% yield. Unreacted 49
was also isolated at the end of the reaction. These yields
presumably arise from diﬀerences in reactivities between the
two stereoisomeric acids in the amidation reaction. After
deprotection in a mixture of methanol, water, and acetic acid
(10:1:0.1) under a H2 atmosphere with 10% Pd/C as the
catalyst, 7 was obtained in 87% yield. Unlike the 5 and 6, N-
acylated monosaccharide 7 did not show any atropisomeric
eﬀects in CD3OD, which we attribute to more eﬃcient amide
bond rotation due to the lack of an adjacent carboxylic acid
group.

Synthesis of Target 8. The synthesis of 8 (Scheme 10)
began with 3-butynol (17), which was converted to α-amino
acid ester 16 following the route reported by Qin and co-
workers.14 Treatment of 16 with NaIO4 and RuCl3 led to a
cascade oxidation−cyclization−oxidation sequence, which
produced N-Boc-protected lactam 15 in 69% yield. Protecting
the tertiary alcohol of 15 with an acetyl group and removing the
Boc group aﬀorded lactam 55 in 82% yield over two steps.
Because lactam 55 was anticipated to be unstable in basic
solution, milder conditions were chosen for the N-methylation
step. Thus, N-hydroxymethylation of lactam 55 was achieved
using paraformaldehyde in acetone in the presence of K2CO3
and water with sonication. To reduce the hemiaminal 56 to an
N-methyl group (i.e., compound 57), we initially explored the
use of Pd/C-catalyzed hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure
in the presence of triﬂuoroacetic acid. However, this reaction
was very slow and only a trace amount of product was formed.
We found, however, that the hemiaminal 56 could be converted
to 57 by treatment with triethylsilane and triﬂuoroacetic acid at
room temperature. N-Methylamide 57 was obtained in 81%
yield over two steps from 55. Hydrolysis of methyl and acetate
esters in 57 failed when LiOH was used in THF and water; the
major product formed was elimination of the acetate to give the
α,β unsaturated carboxylic acid. Fortunately, the use of milder
conditions (1:2:2 TEA−H2O−CH3OH) led to the desired
compound 14 in 82% yield. Amidation of the carboxylic acid 14

similar to that obtained for 7, did not show evidence of

As was the case for 5, comparison of the NMR data for 8

insolubility of 8 in D2O, the solvent used for NMR studies of
the naturally occurring glycan. In this context,
it should be
noted that the synthesis of the enantiomer of 16, which could
also be prepared from 3-butynol using the route described
previously,14 would enable the production of a lactam that
could be used to prepare a derivative 8 with the opposite
stereochemistry in this side-chain appendage.

■ CONCLUSION
In summary, an eﬃcient convergent strategy was developed for
the synthesis of four unusual N-acylated monosaccharides (5−
8) fragments present in LOS-IV from M. marinum. The general

the synthesis of 5−7 was

approach to the targets involved the formation of
lactam
intermediates (40, 44, 49, and 14), which were coupled to
aminosugar 9 and then deprotection of the resulting product.
Monosaccharide 9 was prepared via a conventional route. The
lactam moieties required for the targets were assembled via two
approaches. A key feature of the sequence leading to the lactam
precursors needed for
the
construction of highly substituted oxazolidine−pyrrolinone
bicyclic ring system 11 through a substrate controlled
stereoselective cyclization of α-methoxy-β-keto amide 12.
This reaction installed the two key stereocenters of the lactam
moiety in a single step. A diﬀerent approach was developed to
synthesize the lactam needed for the preparation of target 8. A
cascade oxidation−cyclization−oxidation sequence of amino
acid 16 was used to construct the core lactam 15. Due to the
decomposition under strongly basic conditions, a milder
approach (hemiaminal formation with paraformaldehyde and
K2CO3, followed by reaction with triethylsilane and triﬂuoro-
acetic acid), was used to furnish the N-methyl lactam 14. The
routes developed here will be useful in preparation of building
blocks needed for the synthesis of
the complete LOS-IV
molecule. In addition, 5−8 have been synthesized in a form for

General Experimental Methods. All reagents were purchased
from commercial sources and were used without further puriﬁcation
unless noted. All reactions were monitored by TLC on silica gel 60-
F254 (0.25 mm). Visualization of
the reaction components was
achieved using UV ﬂuorescence (254 nm) and/or by charring with
acidiﬁed anisaldehyde solution in ethanol or KMnO4 in water or
cerium ammonium molybdate stain. Organic solvents were evaporated
under reduced pressure, and the products were puriﬁed by column
chromatography on silica gel (230−400 mesh). Optical rotations were
measured in a microcell (1 cm, 1 mL) at ambient temperature and are
in units of degree·mL/(g·dm). 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 400
MHz, 500 MHz, 600 MHz or 700 Mz, and chemical shifts are
referenced to residual CHCl3 (7.26 ppm, CDCl3), CHD2OD (3.30
ppm, CD3OD), or DMSO-d5 (2.50 ppm, DMSO-d6). 13C NMR
spectra were recorded at 125 MHz, and chemical shifts are referenced
to CDCl3 (77.0 ppm) or CD3OD (49.3 ppm). Reported splitting
patterns are abbreviated as s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m =
multiplet, br = broad, app = apparent. Assignments of NMR spectra
were based on two-dimensional experiments (1H−1H COSY, HSQC
and HMBC), and stereochemistry of the anomeric centers of the
pyranose rings was conﬁrmed by measuring 1JC‑1,H‑1 via coupled
HSQC experiments. ESI/TOF-HRMS spectra were recorded on
samples suspended in THF or CH3OH and added NaCl.

using a Dean−Stark apparatus. The resulting mixture was cooled to
room temperature, and ﬁltered, and the cake was washed with pentane
(2 × 50 mL). The combined ﬁltrate was concentrated to aﬀord crude
product as clear oil, which was used in the next step without further
puriﬁcation. To a solution of the crude product in dry CH2Cl2 (100
mL) at 0 °C were added acetoacetic acid (2.55 g, 25.0 mmol), EDC
hydrochloride (4.8 g, 25.0 mmol), and DMAP (0.25 g, 2.1 mmol). The
mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 16 h, before
being diluted with water and extracted with CH2Cl2. The organic
phases were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated.

(17) A reviewer suggested another possible mechanism: attack of
benzylate anion, generated by elimination of 33, onto alkene 35. We
view this unlikely, however, as such a mechanism would be expected to
generate products with scrambling of the stereochemistry α to the
lactam carbonyl group. Such products were not isolated.
