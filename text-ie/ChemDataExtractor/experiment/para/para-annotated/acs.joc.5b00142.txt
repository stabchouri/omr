ABSTRACT: An eﬃcient and general rhodium(III) catalyzed C2-selective cyanation of indoles and pyrroles was accomplished
employing easily accessible and environmentally friendly cyanating reagent, NCTS. This methodology tolerates various
functional groups, uses readily removable directing groups and allows the synthesis of various 2-cyanoindoles and pyrroles in
good to excellent yield.

C yano heteroarenes, particularly 2-cyanoindoles and

in
various therapeutically important natural products.1 Also, they
are widely used as building blocks for construction of various
pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals (Figure 1), and dyes;
in
addition, incorporation of these moieties in polymers provides
them with unique physical properties.2 Thus, eﬃcient and
selective synthesis of 2-cyanoindoles and pyrroles is highly
desirable in both organic and medicinal chemistry.

the past

Although traditionally cyano(hetero)arenes were synthe-
sized from corresponding aldehydes and their derivatives or
halides,3 over
few decades, selective and direct
cyanation4 of highly abundant C−H bonds of (hetero)arenes
has emerged as a powerful tool to achieve atom- and step-
economy in organic synthesis.5 In this context,
the most
documented direct cyanation of indoles is the transition metal
mediated/catalyzed C3-selective cyanation,6 which is probably
due to the inherent property of indoles (Scheme 1). Typically,
indoles can be achieved using isocyanato-
C3-cyanation of
phosphoric
triphenylthiocyanogen
(TPPT)8 as the cyanating reagent. Recently, these strategies
were replaced with transition metal catalyzed cyanation of
indoles employing tBuNC,9 TMEDA/NH3,10 DMF,11 DMF/
NH4I,12 DMSO/NH4HCO3,13 metal cyanides,14 BnCN,15 3,5-
(CF3)2C6H3I(OTf)CN,16 and N-cyano-N-phenyl-p-toluenesul-
fonamide (NCTS).17 However,
the closely related C2-
selective cyanation of
indoles and related heteroarenes is
rather limited.

isocyanide9,18 as “CN” source in
cyanation using tert-butyl
combination with 3 equiv of copper
salt and the sub-
stoichiometric copper catalyzed cyanation employing acetoni-
trile19 as “CN” source along with additives such as AgOAc or
(Me3Si)2 (Scheme 2). These reactions suﬀer from the use of
high catalyst
super-stoichiometric amounts of
expensive additives, harsh reaction conditions, and limited
substrate scope. Thus,
the eﬃcient catalytic C2-selective

cyanation of indoles (pyrroles) is highly warranted. Based on
the need for catalytic cyanation and our interest in C−H
functionalization20 and cyanation employing readily accessible
and environmentally benign NCTS as a cyanating reagent,21
we herein reveal
the general rhodium catalyzed chelation
assisted selective C2-cyanation of indoles and pyrroles with
NCTS.
<para sub=“opt”>
Initially, we investigated the C2-cyanation of

indole
derivatives. The C2-cyanation of N-(2-pyridyl)indole 1a with
NCTS (2 equiv) was performed in the presence of
[Cp*RhCl2]2 (1 mol %) as a catalyst and AgSbF6 (10 mol
%) as an additive in toluene at 100 °C for 36 h.21 To our
delight, 2-cyano-N-(2-pyridyl)indole 3a was observed in 20%
isolated yield (Table 1, entry1). No reaction was observed in
the absence of either [Cp*RhCl2]2 or AgSbF6, which shows
that cyanation is catalyzed and promoted by rhodium and
silver complex, respectively.22 Next, a slight improvement in
yield was observed with the temperature increasing to 120 °C
(Table 1, entry 2). Increasing the ratio of rhodium to silver
complex by adding 2 mol % of rhodium complex gave better
conversion with 56% isolated yield of 3a, but the opposite
eﬀect was observed when the silver complex was reduced to 5
mol % to increase the ratio of Rh(III)/Ag(I) (Table 1, entries
3 and 4).

<para sub=“opt”>
Although cyanation in solvents like chlorobenzene and 1,2-
tAmOH gave the
DCE was inferior to cyanation in toluene,
formation of product 3a in 82% isolated yield with complete
conversion of 1a in 18 h (Table 1, entres 5−7). Interestingly,
decreasing the catalyst loading to 1 mol % in tAmOH did not
aﬀect
importantly, a similar eﬀect was
observed when the equivalents of cyanating reagent were
reduced to 1 equiv and the product 3a was isolated in
comparable yield (Table 1, entries 8−10). Finally, using 1
equiv of NCTS and 1.2 equiv of 1a in tAmOH at 120 °C with

the reaction. Most

Scheme 2, the optimized conditions tolerate functional groups
at various position (C3, C4, and C5) of N-(2-pyridyl)indoles
to aﬀord the corresponding product in good to excellent yield.
Simple aryl and readily functionalizable bromo-substituted
cyanoindoles (3b and 3c) were achieved in 76% and 77%
yield, respectively. Interestingly, the reaction tolerates both
electron donating (methoxy and benzyloxy) and electron-

withdrawing groups (tosyloxy and cyano) on the indole
moiety and led to the formation of corresponding 2-
cyanoindoles (3d−3h) in good yields. Sterically demanding
C−H possessing 3-methyl and 3-(carbomethoxy)methyl
substituted indoles were also readily converted to correspond-
ing cyanated product (3i and 3j) in 96% and 82% yield,
respectively. Similarly, substitutions on the directing group
were also examined. All the pyridine derivatives that were
examined helped the chelation-assisted cyanation and led to
the formation of cyanated product (3k−3m) in good yield.
Instead of pyridine, other chelating groups like quinoline and
pyrimidine were also studied. N-(2-Quinolyl)indole and N-(2-
pyrimidyl)indole underwent smooth reaction to aﬀord the
products 3n and 3o in 71% and 46% yield, respectively.
However, substrate with an additional coordination site gave
comparatively lower yields.

Subsequently, we extended the optimized conditions to
pyrrole-based derivatives. Initial attempts with N-(pyridyl)-
pyrrole 4a aﬀorded only moderate yield of 2-cyano-N-
(pyridyl)pyrrole 5a. By changing the catalyst
the

2-Methyl and 2,3-fused pyrroles, sterically demanding pyrrole

optimized reaction tolerates various functional groups,
like
benzoyl, acetyl, and ester,
to aﬀord the corresponding
products (5f−5h) in moderate yield. Furthermore, cyanation
of pyrrole containing various chelating pyridines derivatives
also furnished the product (5i−5l) in good to excellent yield.

General Procedure for Rhodium Catalyzed C2 Cyanation of
N-Pyridyl Pyrrole (5). A dry reaction tube (10 mL) was charged
with heteroarene 4 (0.24 mmol), N-cyano-N-phenyl-p-toluenesulfo-
namide 2 (54 mg, 0.2 mmol), [Cp*RhCl2]2 (3.7 mg, 0.006 mmol, 3
mol %), AgSbF6 (6.8 mg, 0.02 mmol, 10 mol %), and dry tAmOH
(1.5 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction tube was sealed
under nitrogen atmosphere and the reaction mixture was stirred at
120 °C for 18 h. After the completion of the reaction, as monitored
by TLC analysis,
the reaction mixture was cooled to room
temperature and puriﬁed by column chromatography using mixture
of hexane and ethyl acetate as eluent to aﬀord the pure cyanated
product 5.
