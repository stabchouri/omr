ABSTRACT: The Diels−Alder reaction represents one of the
most thoroughly studied and well-understood synthetic trans-
formations for the assembly of six-membered rings. Although
intramolecular dehydro-Diels−Alder (IMDDA) reactions have
previously been employed for the preparation of naphthalene
and dihydronaphthalene substrates,
low yields and product
mixtures have reduced the impact and scope of this reaction.
Through the mechanistic studies described within, we have
conﬁrmed that the thermal IMDDA reaction of styrene−ynes produces a naphthalene product via loss of hydrogen gas from the
initially formed cycloadduct, a tetraenyl intermediate. Alternatively, the dihydronaphthalene product is aﬀorded from the same
tetraenyl intermediate via a radical isomerization process. Moreover, we have identiﬁed conditions that can be used to achieve
eﬃcient, high-yielding, and selective IMDDA reactions of styrene−ynes to form either naphthalene or dihydronaphthalene
products. The operational simplicity and retrosynthetic orthogonality of this method for the preparation of naphthalenes and
dihydronaphthalenes makes this transformation appealing for the synthesis of medicinal and material targets. The mechanistic
studies within may impact the development of other thermal transformations.

■ INTRODUCTION

Functionalized naphthalenes and their derivatives are valuable
building blocks that serve as key structural components for
various material, chemical, and biological applications. Naph-
thalenes are used as organic semiconductors in organic light-
emitting diodes (OLEDs)1 and liquid crystalline displays
(LCDs).2 They are also commonly incorporated into
pharmaceuticals3 and chiral
reagents.4 A classic example
showcasing the importance of this motif is naproxen (2) and
its derivatives. These COX-2 selective anti-inﬂammatory agents
are obtained via an asymmetric hydrogenation of methox-
ynaphthenyl acrylic acid (1) in which high enantioselectivities
were achieved by employing the chiral biaryl ligand (R)-BINAP
(3), as depicted in Scheme 1.5 Naphthalenes are present in a
number of naturally occurring compounds,6 one example being
michellamine B (4), a compound that captured the attention of
the research community because of its activity against HIV, as
well as
its unusual C2-symmetric naphthylisoquinoline
structure.7 Naphthalenes possessing electron-donor and -ac-
ceptor groups also play an important role in bioimaging
applications.8 For example, dansyl, the structure represented in
the box of the guanidinium-rich molecular transporter (MoTr)
5, was used as a ﬂuorescent probe to measure the cellular
uptake eﬃciency of MoTr analogues.9 Additionally, certain
bacterial genetic codes have been expanded to include the
nonnatural naphthalene- and benzo-fused heterocycle base pair

d5SICS-dNaM (6).10 By incorporating these nonnatural base
pairs into bacterial DNA, nonnatural amino acids were created
in vitro using the cellular machinery. These and other
applications have revealed functionalized naphthalenes as
desirable synthetic targets, but methods to access this valuable
class of aromatic compounds have not kept up with the demand
for new, diverse, and structurally complex naphthalene
substrates.

Because naphthalene represents

the most abundant
component of coal tar,11 it has been exploited in the industrial
scale production of dyes, plastics, and insecticides, to name a
few. Moreover, the methods by which naphthalene-containing
compounds have conventionally been obtained are directed
largely by an abundance of this feedstock. As an example,
electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions of naph-
thalene, such as Friedel−Crafts acylations and alkylations,
halogenations, and nitrations, are commonly used protocols to
prepare functionalized naphthalene-containing compounds.12
While these methods have their place in the synthetic chemist’s
toolbox, alternative strategies that provide more complex
naphthalene substructures not readily available using EAS and

other classical reactions are needed. Others have recognized the
limitations imposed by these more classical approaches and
have responded with new methods for naphthalene synthesis,13
including transition-metal-catalyzed cross-coupling14 and tran-
sition-metal-mediated reactions,15 Diels−Alder
reactions of
benzyne16 or o-quinodimethane derivatives,17 phthalide annu-
lations,18
ring-closing metathesis,19 and [2 + 2 + 2]
cycloaddition reactions.20 Also gaining widespread use is an
acid-catalyzed benzannulation via [4 + 2] cycloaddition
reaction of o-alkynyl(oxo)benzenes with alkynes discovered
by Yamamoto.21
Intramolecular dehydro-Diels−Alder (IMDDA) reactions
have previously been used for the construction of naphthalenes
and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.22 When aromatic
products are preferred,
IMDDA reactions are typically
conducted with substrates containing two reactive triple
bonds and one double bond. However, examples exist where
aromatic products have been obtained from IMDDA precursors
having one triple bond and two double bonds, a reaction that
should aﬀord the dihydroaromatic product. The formation of
this product has in some cases been justiﬁed by the propensity
of 1,4-cyclohexadiene derivatives to aromatize under oxidative
conditions. Along similar lines, a potentially valuable IMDDA
reaction for the preparation of aromatic hydrocarbons involves
the reaction of styrene and an alkyne to aﬀord a cycloadduct
that aromatizes to give naphthalene derivatives. Despite the
tendency for styrene polymerization,
this
reaction has been demonstrated, albeit with mixtures of
products and/or low yields.23

Klemm was the ﬁrst to report an IMDDA reaction where
styrenyl alkynoate 7 was reﬂuxed in acetic anhydride to provide
dihydronaphthyl lactone 9 in 48% yield (Scheme 2).24 When a
similar IMDDA precursor 10 containing a terminal alkyne was
used, only the naphthyl lactone 11 was obtained, but in 13%
yield.25 Cycloaddition of amide 13 gave naphthalene lactam 14

in 51% yield.26 More recently, Chackalamannil eﬀected an
IMDDA reaction of alkynoate 16 to aﬀord dihydronaphthofur-
anone 18 in 57% yield, along with naphthyl lactone 17; the
unusual position of the double bond in 18 was discussed.27
Ruijter has reported an IMDDA reaction of styrene-function-
alized β-carboline 19 that generated compounds 20 and 21 in a
1.5:1 ratio and 90% yield.28 Interestingly, attempts to oxidize
the product mixture to 20 using DDQ led to decomposition.
Terashima reported the IMDDA reaction of alkynone 22,
which provided only 23 in quantitative yield.29 Finally,
Matsubara has reported an IMDDA reaction of silyl acetylene
24 that produced only the naphthalene product 25 in 80%
yield; ten additional examples were reported.30 While this
nearly exhaustive listing of research in the area of IMDDA
reactions of
this
reaction,31 its potential has not been realized due to harsh
reaction conditions,
long reaction times, mixtures of
naphthalene and dihydronaphthalene compounds, and the
inability to predict which product will be obtained.

the formation of

selectivity for
the aromatic product.
Investigation into the scope and limitations of the IMDDA
reaction of styrene−ynes began by making variations to the
alkyne terminus and ultimately showed selective formation of a
number of naphthalene products in high yield.33 Further studies
involving the addition of heteroatoms to the styrene−yne
tether resulted in very diﬀerent product mixtures. For example,
replacing the all carbon tether of 26 with heteroatom-
containing tethers 28 (X = O) and 30 (X = NTs) and
subjecting these styrene−ynes to our standard microwave
irradiation (MWI) reaction conditions aﬀorded naphthalenes
29a and 31a in low yield. Additionally, dihydronaphthalenes
29b and 31b were obtained in 15% and 56% yields, respectively
for styrene−yne 30
(entries 2 and 3, Table 1). Notably,
containing a tosylamide tether, the dihydronaphthalene product
31b was formed as the major product.

Concentration, Temperature, and Atmosphere Stud-
ies. To further explore this result, styrene−yne 30 was
subjected to reaction conditions that involved changing the
temperature, concentration, and atmosphere. Among the
various experiments that were performed,
four key results
have emerged to alter our thoughts regarding this reaction.
Prolonging microwave irradiation of 30 for 60 min at 180 °C in
DCE aﬀorded less dihydronaphthalene 31b when compared to
an example that was irradiated for 10 min (compare entries 3
and 4, Table 1, 8% vs 56%); however,
the increase in
naphthalene 31a was not proportionate (38% vs 30%). This
data conﬁrms that under extended reaction times, dihydro-
naphthalene 31b is not
transforming to naphthalene 31a.
Lowering the temperature of the reaction from 180 to 120 °C
aﬀorded a higher ratio of 31b to 31a of 7.6:1 vs 1.9:1 (compare
entries 3 and 5, Table 1); the mass balance for entry 5 was
recovered starting material (34%).
Increasing the reaction
temperature to 225 °C resulted in a reversal of selectivity,
giving a 1:1.5 ratio of 31b:31a (entry 6). Thus,
lower
temperatures favor formation of dihydronaphthalene 31b, and
higher reaction temperatures produce more naphthalene 31a.
Increasing the reaction concentration from 0.06 to 0.50 M
resulted in a 3.8:1 mixture of the dihydronaphthalene 31b and
naphthalene 31a products (entry 7). As discussed in further
</para>
Article
<para sub=“opt”>
detail below, this data combined with the temperature studies
suggests the possibility that two diﬀerent reaction mechanisms
are operating to produce the two products. Irradiating styrene−
yne 30 at 180 °C in DCE either under air or after degassing the
reaction mixture with argon both generated a 1.9:1 mixture of
dihydronaphthalene 31b to naphthalene 31a in as little as 2
min (see Table S1 (Supporting Information) for a complete
listing of experimental conditions employed). While these
conditions did not ensure rigorous exclusion of oxygen, this
experiment
indicates that performing the reaction in the
presence or absence of oxygen has no eﬀect on the product
selectivity or the rate of reaction for the time scale that was
measured. This data strongly suggests that molecular oxygen is
not functioning as an adventitious oxidant of dihydronaph-
thalene 31b to naphthalene 31a. These thought-provoking
results support the need for a more thorough understanding of
the mechanism of product formation in this reaction prior to
embarking on further scope and limitation studies. A discussion
of the results from these mechanistic investigations is provided
herein.

Solvent Studies. The IMDDA reaction of 30 was carried
temperature of 180 °C in solvents of
out at a constant
increasing dielectric constant ranging from o-DCB (ε = 9.93) to
water (ε = 80.10). Regardless of the solvent employed, each
reaction was complete within 1 min. While there are some
outlying results, the dielectric constant of the solvent appears to
correlate well with the selectivity of the reaction, with product
ratios of 31a:31b ranging from 1:1.2 to 1:10 as the dielectric
constant of the solvent increases (entries 1−4 and 8, Table
2).34 A control experiment was performed where 30 was

31a:31b, but with no deuterium incorporation (see the
Supporting Information). One outlier in the solvent data was
nitrobenzene (PhNO2), which aﬀorded exclusively naphthalene
31a in 84% yield. We attribute this result to PhNO2 functioning
as a dehydrogenating agent,35 and this is supported by the fact
that as little as 8 equiv of PhNO2 resulted in selective
naphthalene formation (see Table S2, Supporting Information).
Thus, solvent does play a signiﬁcant role in the selectivity
aﬀorded by the IMDDA reaction for
the formation of
naphthalene or dihydronaphthalene products.

In an additional
experiment, heating of styrene−yne-d5 42 for 1 min at 180
°C in o-DCB-d4 resulted in a 1:1 mixture of naphthalene 45 and
dihydronaphthalene 46 in 68% yield. Naphthalene 45 was
separated from 46 by HPLC, and characterization of 46 by 1H
NMR and COSY spectroscopy showed the presence of two
diastereomers in a 1.5:1 ratio resulting from deuterium
incorporation at the 4-position of the dihydronaphthalene,
which was indicative of deuterium atom transfer from the aryl
ring. Incorporation of a deuterium atom at the 4-position of the
dihydronaphthalene altered the 1H NMR spectrum of 46,
allowing for the diastereomeric ratio to be distinguished. For
example, the doublet of doublets and apparent triplet found at δ
2.82 and 2.51, representative of the two protons at the 4-
position of 31b (Figure 1A), each changed upon deuterium
incorporation in 46 and became two doublets (Hd and He)
integrating for 0.69 and 0.47 protons,
respectively. The
coupling constants of Hd and He were reﬂective of coupling
only to the neighboring proton (Hc) and not germinal coupling
(Figure 1B). Additional smaller resonances at δ 2.89, 2.86, 2.81,
2.80, and 2.54, which were similar to the resonances observed
for 31b, were also noted in the 1H NMR spectrum of 46.

As expected, heating 42 in DMF under the same reaction

with a much greater diastereoselectivity of 14:1 for the opposite
diastereomer (Scheme 4). This change in diastereoselectivity
was also obvious from the 1H NMR spectrum of 46, in which
the doublet at δ 2.50 (He) was now much more prominent in
comparison to the doublet at δ 2.80 (Hd), with integrations of
0.95 and 0.07, respectively (Figure 1C).

31a from 30% in the absence of TEMPO to 52% in the
presence of TEMPO may be explained by TEMPO acting as an
oxidant during the reaction.41 The overall lower yield of the

Mechanism for the Formation of Naphthalene. The
data above presents compelling support for the mechanism of
formation of dihydronaphthalene; however, this data does not
provide a satisfying explanation for how the naphthalene
product is generated, aside from evidence strongly suggesting
that
the naphthalene is not produced directly from
dihydronaphthalene (entries 3 and 4, Table 1). The lack of
evidence for oxidation of dihydronaphthalene to naphthalene,
along with the large primary kinetic isotope eﬀect observed
(Scheme 4), implies that the naphthalene and dihydronaph-
thalene products are being formed by diverging mechanistic
pathways. One possible pathway by which the naphthalene
could be formed is a concerted elimination of hydrogen gas via
the same tetraene intermediate 50, a process that was originally
proposed by Matsubara (Scheme 8).30

Scheme 8. Proposed Mechanism for Generation of
Naphthalene via Concerted Loss of H2

to what we suggest for the formation of the naphthalene 31a.
One such example was published by Wellington and Walters,
where thermal decomposition of 2,5-dihydrofuran showed
production of both furan and H2 in equal amounts (eq 1,
Scheme 9).43 Similar reports that were published independently

Scheme 9. Unimolecular Elimination Reactions

by Ellis and Frey or Benson and Shaw demonstrated a related
unimolecular elimination of H2 for 1,4-cyclohexadiene in the
generation of benzene (eq 2).44 Recently, a triphosphabenzene
was reduced under 4 atm of hydrogen pressure via a reversible
1,4-H2 addition (eq 3).45
<para sub="scope">
To test the hypothesis that the tetraene intermediate 50
would undergo a concerted unimolecular elimination of H2 to
generate naphthalene 31a, we performed several
IMDDA
reactions with the goal of detecting H2. We previously
established that conventional heating and microwave irradiation
conditions provided nearly identical results for the IMDDA
reaction, and we envisioned that H2 could potentially be
observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy if the IMDDA reaction was
conducted in a sealed NMR tube using conventional heating.
After heating styrene−yne 30 in o-DCB-d4 at 180 °C for 2 min,
a 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction mixture was acquired
which showed the presence of a new singlet at δ 4.73 that was
not attributed to the products 31a or 31b; this resonance was
assumed to correspond to H2 that was formed during the
reaction (Figure 2). To conﬁrm that this resonance was H2,
additional H2 was bubbled through the reaction mixture and an
increase in the integration value for the resonance at δ 4.73
from 0.05 to 0.09 was observed, indicating that this resonance
was correctly identiﬁed as H2. Argon was also bubbled through
the reaction mixture which resulted in the disappearance of this
resonance from the 1H NMR spectrum. This information

supports our hypothesis that H2 was being produced during the
reaction; however, only the quantity of H2 in solution could be
determined using this approach.
</para>
<para sub="scope">
In order to quantify the amount of H2 gas that was produced
during the IMDDA reaction, gas chromatography (GC) was
utilized to examine the headspace of the reaction. For the GC
experiments, styrene−yne 30 was irradiated for 1 min at 180 °C
in o-DCB (see the Supporting Information). Based upon the
average 80% yield and 1:1.2 ratio of naphthalene 31a and
dihydronaphthalene 31b products typically generated for these
IMDDA reactions, the theoretical yield of H2 was calculated
(see Supporting Information). Overall, a 39−48% yield of H2
was determined by GC for these experiments. These results
indicate that a substantial amount of H2 is produced during the
IMDDA reaction, and that the original hypothesis in which the
naphthalene product is formed via intramolecular concerted
elimination of H2 from tetraene intermediate 50 is supported
(Scheme 8).

<para sub="scope">
With experimental evidence in hand supporting diverging
reaction mechanisms for the formation of naphthalene and
dihydronaphthalene products, further mechanistic insight was
gained through quantum chemical calculations.46 Both the
direct expulsion of H2 and hydrogen atom abstraction by triplet
oxygen, aﬀording the naphthalene and dihydronaphthalene
products, respectively, were examined for tetraene 50. The
results from these calculations predict
the hydrogen atom
abstraction process to be more favorable by 9.8 kcal/mol
(Figure 3). This data correlates with the 2-fold preference for
formation of the dihydronaphthalene over the naphthalene
product at 180 °C (entry 3, Table 1). Likewise, at lower
temperatures an 8-fold preference for the dihydronaphthalene
was observed (120 °C, entry 5, Table 1), whereas at higher
temperatures the opposite product selectivity was aﬀorded (225
°C, entry 6, Table 1).

Predicting selectivity for the formation of the dihydronaph-
thalene or naphthalene product may also be possible from the
calculated through-space distance between the ﬂagpole hydro-
gens of the corresponding tetraene intermediates. For example,
for the tetraene intermediate with the all-carbon tether, 53, the
−Hb distance was calculated to be 3.05 Å. By comparison,
Ha
this distance for tetraene 50, containing a tosylamide tether,
was 3.63 Å, representing a diﬀerence of nearly 0.6 Å. These
calculated distances correlate well with our experimental
observations for product selectivity, where a shorter calculated
distance between the hydrogen atoms aﬀords the naphthalene

product selectively, and a longer distance favors dihydronaph-
thalene formation. For example, an IMDDA reaction of the all-
carbon tether precursor 26 aﬀorded the naphthalene product in
27a quantitative yield, whereas reaction of
the tosylamide
tether-containing substrate 30 produced the dihydronaphtha-
lene 31b in 56% yield and the naphthalene 31a in 30% yield
when reacted under identical conditions (entries 1 and 3, Table
1). It is interesting to note that for the latter case, we can alter
this product
favor dihydronaphthalene
formation by lowering the reaction temperature (entry 5,
Table 1). For the ether tether 54, the Ha-Hb calculated distance
is 3.58 Å and the dihydronaphthalene was aﬀorded in 15% yield
and the naphthalene in 28% yield (entry 2, Table 1). To help
explain this anomalous 1:2 ratio, we suspect that decomposition
of the dihydronaphthalene 29b during the longer reaction time
may be skewing this data, as suggested by the low yields.

■ CONCLUSIONS
In summary, the naphthalene and dihydronaphthalene product
distribution aﬀorded from the IMDDA reaction of styrene−
ynes is attributed to mechanistic divergence. Compelling
evidence, such as the isotopic labeling and hydrogen gas
detection experiments provided herein, supports the premise
that both products are obtained from a common intermediate.
An understanding of the mechanisms of formation of each of
these products can potentially allow for better control of
product selectivity during the IMDDA reaction through tuning
of
the reaction substrates and conditions. While previous
examples of thermal IMDDA reactions have been reported with
variable results, this represents the ﬁrst systematic study of the
mechanism of the IMDDA reaction of styrene−ynes for the
production of both naphthalene and dihydronaphthalene
products. Furthermore, we expect
these mechanistic
studies, along with the operational simplicity and synthetic
orthogonality of this approach, will transform the IMDDA
reaction into a synthetically useful alternative for
the
preparation of naphthalene and dihydronaphthalenes, as well
as other previously inaccessible aromatic compounds. Finally,
the removal of hydrogen gas from IMDDA adducts to form
aromatic compounds oﬀers an environmentally benign
alternative to typical oxidation protocols.47

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General Experimental Methods. Dichloromethane (DCM) and
tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried by passing through alumina, and
triethylamine was freshly distilled from CaH2 prior to use. 1H and 13C
NMR spectra were referenced to residual chloroform (7.26 ppm for
1H NMR spectroscopy, 77.16 ppm for 13C NMR spectroscopy), 1,2-
dichlorobenzene (7.14 ppm for 1H NMR spectroscopy), or N,N-
dimethylformamide (8.38 ppm for 1H NMR spectroscopy). Chemical
shifts are reported in ppm; multiplicities are indicated by s (singlet), b
s (broad singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), p (pentet), and
m (multiplet). In experiments where yields were determined by 1H
NMR spectroscopy, p-dimethoxybenzene was used as an internal
standard. A standard solution of p-dimethoxybenzene (20 mg) in o-
DCB-d4 (0.5 mL) was prepared so that quantities of p-dimethox-
ybenzene could be accurately added to the reaction mixtures. All
microwave-mediated reactions were conducted in either a Biotage
Initiator Exp microwave synthesizer or in an Anton-Paar Monowave
300 microwave synthesizer. The temperature of reactions in the
Monowave 300 was monitored internally by a ruby sensor probe,
unless otherwise speciﬁed. The microwave parameters were set to
variable power, constant temperature, stirring on, and a ﬁxed hold
time. Styrene-yne 30, naphthalene 31a, and dihydronaphthalene 31b
were prepared and characterized according to procedures previously
reported by our laboratory.14i See the Supporting Information for
additional general methods and details.
General Microwave Irradiation Procedure. To a microwave
irradiation vial were added styrene−yne and the reaction solvent (0.06
M). The solution was irradiated at 180 °C for 1 min, followed by
concentration of the reaction mixture under high vacuum. The crude
material was puriﬁed by silica gel column chromatography to yield the
naphthalene and/or dihydronaphthalene as a solid. Mixtures of
naphthalene and dihydronaphthalene products were separated for
characterization by HPLC. Experiments conducted under argon
involved initial degassing of the starting solution by bubbling with
argon through the septum of the microwave irradiation vial for 30 min
prior to irradiation.

Irradiation of 30 in DMF-d7. To a G4 Anton-Paar microwave
irradiation vial were added styrene−yne 30 (0.020 g, 0.054 mmol) and
DMF-d7 (0.91 mL). The solution was irradiated at 180 °C for 1 min,
turning the reaction mixture orange in color. The reaction mixture was
then concentrated under high vacuum and the crude material puriﬁed
by silica gel ﬂash column chromatography (1.5 cm, 20% ethyl acetate/
hexanes) to yield the title compounds as a white solid and as a 1:10
mixture of 31a and 31b (0.015 g, 75%). These products were
separated for characterization by HPLC, utilizing 10% ethyl acetate/
hexanes as the eluent and a ﬂow rate of 4 mL/min. The HPLC
retention time of naphthalene 31a was 34.2 min and the retention
time of dihydronaphthalene 31b was 38.2 min. An 1H NMR spectrum

Irradiation of 30 in the Presence of 1,4-Cyclohexadiene. To
an NMR tube were added styrene−yne 30 (0.013 g, 0.036 mmol), o-
DCB-d4 (0.55 mL), and a solution of p-dimethoxybenzene in o-DCB-
d4 (50 μL, 0.002 g) as an internal standard. A 1H NMR spectrum of
the solution was obtained, followed by transfer of the solution to a G4
Anton-Paar microwave irradiation vial and addition of 1,4-cyclo-
hexadiene (34 μL, 0.36 mmol). The solution was then irradiated at
180 °C for 1 min, turning the reaction mixture light brown in color.
The reaction mixture was then transferred to an NMR tube, and a 1H
NMR spectrum was obtained showing conversion of the starting
material 30 to products 31a and 31b as a 1:1.2 mixture in 81%
combined yield (Supporting Information).
Irradiation of 30 in the Presence of TEMPO. To a 0.5−2 mL
Biotage microwave irradiation vial were added styrene−yne 30 (0.022
g, 0.060 mmol), DCE (1.0 mL), and (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-
yl)oxy (0.014 g, 0.090 mmol). The solution was then irradiated at 180
°C for 1 min, turning the reaction mixture dark brown in color. The
reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the
crude material puriﬁed by silica gel ﬂash column chromatography
(10% ethyl acetate−hexanes) to yield 31a as a light yellow solid (0.011
g, 52%).
Conventional Heating and Hydrogen Detection by 1H NMR
Spectroscopy. To a screw-cap NMR tube were added styrene−yne
30 (0.013 g, 0.036 mmol), o-DCB-d4 (0.55 mL), and a solution of p-
dimethoxybenzene in o-DCB-d4 (50 μL, 0.002 g) as an internal
standard via pipet. The cap was screwed onto the NMR tube, and an
1H NMR spectrum of the starting solution was obtained. The solution
was then heated at 180 °C for 2 min in an oil bath, turning the
reaction mixture brown in color. A 1H NMR spectrum of the reaction
mixture was obtained showing conversion of the starting material 30 to
the products 31a and 31b as a 1:1.2 mixture in 86% combined yield
(Supporting Information).

The 1H NMR spectrum of the products also showed the presence
of hydrogen gas (H2) in solution as a singlet integrating for 0.06H at
4.73 ppm (Supporting Information), which indicated a 11:1 ratio of
31a:H2. To conﬁrm that this resonance corresponded to H2, H2 was
bubbled through the reaction mixture and another 1H NMR spectrum
was obtained which showed an increase in the integration value from
0.06 to 0.10H, representing a 6:1 ratio of 31a:H2 (Supporting
Information). Argon was then bubbled through the reaction mixture,
and the resonance corresponding to H2 disappeared (see Figure 2
manuscript).

deuteride (0.877 g, 20.9 mmol). The round-bottomed ﬂask was
evacuated and reﬁlled with argon (3×), and THF (35 mL) was added
via syringe with stirring. 3-Phenyl-2-propyn-1-ol (32) (2.0 mL, 16
mmol) in THF (5 mL) was then added slowly dropwise via syringe,
and bubbling occurred along with a color change from dark to light
gray. The reaction mixture was heated to reﬂux in an oil bath for 5 h,
turning the reaction mixture brown, followed by cooling to rt then 0
°C in an ice bath. To quench the reaction, water was added slowly
dropwise and vigorous bubbling occurred. Once bubbling had ceased
and the reaction mixture had become white in color, diethyl ether was
added, and the aqueous layer was separated. The aqueous layer was
then extracted with diethyl ether (2×), and the combined organic
layers were washed with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, gravity
ﬁltered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield the title
compound as a clear oil (2.23 g, quant). The crude material was

Crossover Study. To a G4 Anton-Parr microwave irradiation vial
were added styrene−ynes 30 (6.6 mg, 0.018 mmol) and 43 (7.0 mg,
0.018 mmol) in o-DCB (0.3 mL). The solution was irradiated at 180
°C. After 1 min, the reaction of 30 was complete by TLC, but a
signiﬁcant amount of 43 remained. The reaction was irradiated for an
additional 2 min until complete by TLC. After irradiation, the reaction
mixture was orange/brown in color. The reaction mixture was then
concentrated under high vacuum, and the crude brown oil was
subjected to HPLC, utilizing 10% ethyl acetate/hexanes as the eluent
and a ﬂow rate of 4 mL/min. The HPLC chromatogram showed four
major peaks with retention times of 27.284, 28.707, 34.210, and 38.200
min, which were collected and characterized by ESI-MS (Figure S2,
Supporting Information). Characterization showed that all
six
potential compounds of the crossover experiment were present within
the four HPLC peaks isolated. The data pertaining to which HPLC
peaks contained which products, as well as comparison of
found
masses to calculated masses, are listed in Table S3 (Supporting

(46) Calculations were performed with GAUSSIAN09 (Frisch, M. J.
et al., full reference in the Supporting Information). Geometries were
optimized using the M06-2X functional with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis
set, and stationary points were characterized as minima or transition
state structures using frequency calculations at the same level: Zhao,
Y.; Truhlar, D. Theor. Chem. Acc 2008, 120, 215.
Intrinsic reaction
coordinate (IRC) calculations were used to further characterize
transition-state structures: Gonzalez, C.; Schlegel, H. B. J. Phys. Chem.
1990, 94, 5523. Fukui, K. Acc. Chem. Res. 1981, 14, 363. Free energies

method: Marenich, A. V.; Cramer, C. J.; Truhlar, D. G. J. Phys. Chem. B
2009, 113, 6378. Structural images were created using Ball&Stick:
