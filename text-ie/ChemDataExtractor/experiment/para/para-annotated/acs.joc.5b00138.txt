ABSTRACT: A direct construction of 1,2-trans-β-linked 2-acetamido-2-
deoxyglycosides was investigated. The 3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl- and 3,4,6-tri-O-
acetyl-protected glycosyl diethyl phosphites and 4,6-O-benzylidene-protected
galactosyl diethyl phosphite each reacted with a variety of acceptor alcohols in
the presence of a stoichiometric amount of Tf2NH in CH2Cl2 at −78 °C to aﬀord the corresponding β-glycosides in good to high
yields with complete stereoselectivity. Some experiments provided strong evidence that the corresponding oxazolinium ions are
not responsible for the reaction. We demonstrated that glycosylations with the corresponding glycosyl imidate and thioglycoside
also proceeded at a low temperature, indicating the possibility of these donors being attractive alternatives to the phosphite. A
plausible reaction mechanism, which features glycosyl triﬂimide and contact ion pair as reactive intermediates, is proposed on the
basis of the results obtained with 2-acetamido-2-deoxymannosyl donors.

■ INTRODUCTION

2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glycosides are ubiquitous building
blocks of glycolipids, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and
peptidoglycans and are associated with a wide range of
biological processes.1 For example, serine/threonine hydroxy
groups in nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are glycosylated
with 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucoses as a posttranslational
modiﬁcation of proteins that are thought to modulate the
functions of proteins in cells. The majority of 2-acetamido-2-
deoxysugars are found as β-linked glycosides, whereas 2-
acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose residues are α-linked to serine/
threonine hydroxy groups.2,3

For the synthesis of 1,2-trans-β-glycosides of 2-acetamido-2-
deoxysugars,4 the most general and extensively developed
strategy utilizes donors containing a participating group as the
amino-protecting functionality that are replaced by an acetyl
group after the glycosylation event. A variety of 2-amino
protecting groups such as N-phthaloyl,5 N-2,2,2-trichloroethox-
ycarbonyl (Troc),6,7 N-allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc),7 N-benzylox-
ycarbonyl (Cbz),7 N-trichloroacetyl (TCA),8 N-tetrachloroph-
thaloyl (TCP),9 N-dithiasuccinoyl (Dts),10 N,N-diacetyl,11 N-
4,5-dichlorophthaloyl (DCPhth),12 N-acetyl-N-2,2,2-trichloroe-
thoxycarbonyl,13 N-p-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl,14 N-dimethylma-
leoyl (DMM),15 N,N-dibenzyl,16 N-thiodiglycoloyl (TDG),17
and N-dimethylphosphoryl (DMP)18 have been employed for
this purpose. Despite their electronically nonparticipating
nature, the synthetic utility of 2,5-dimethyl-1-pyrrolyl19 and
azido groups20,21 as amino group equivalents has also been
demonstrated.22,23

Although these indirect methods provide reliable access to
1,2-trans-β-glycosides of 2-acetamido-2-deoxysugars, additional
synthetic steps are required for the substrate preparation.
Therefore, it is clear that the use of donor 1 with natural N-
acetyl
functionality would constitute an ideal procedure in
terms of eﬃciency and practicality (Scheme 1). In practice,

Scheme 1. Glycosylation with 2-Acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl
Donor 1

the reaction of donor 1 generally leads to the
however,
preferential formation of oxazoline derivative 3 via neighboring
group participation and subsequent abstraction of a proton
from the formed oxazolinium ion intermediate 2.24 Oxazoline 3
can be activated with Brønsted or Lewis acids to regenerate
oxazolinium ion 2 or 4, which upon treatment with an acceptor
alcohol provides 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-glycoside 5,25 but the
harsh reaction conditions required for this conversion have
precluded its wide application in the synthesis of complex
oligosaccharides.

Over

the past 25 years, we have developed novel
glycosylation reactions capitalizing on phosphorus-containing
leaving groups.26 Using donors with these leaving groups,
various types of glycosidic linkages could be constructed in a
stereoselective manner by appropriate choice of
reaction
conditions.27−29 We anticipated that, with the proper selection
of reaction conditions, high-yielding access to 1,2-trans-β-
glycosides might be realized by glycosylation with a 2-

acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl donor carrying a phosphorus-
containing leaving group. In this article, we document the
scope and mechanism of Tf2NH-promoted glycosylation with
2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl diethyl phosphite.30 An extension
of this study using a variety of 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl
donors revealed that 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosides could be
obtained by glycosylations at a low temperature irrespective of
the leaving group employed, although the reaction did not
proceed through the intermediacy of
the corresponding
oxazolinium ions. The details of this investigation are also
reported herein.

■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub="scope">
2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glycosyl donors were prepared accord-
ing to standard procedures. While α-linked glycosyl diethyl
phosphites 9a, 9c, 11a, and 11c were stereoselectively obtained
in excellent yields (87−90%) by phosphitylation of
the
corresponding hemiacetals with diethyl chlorophosphite,29a,31
the reaction of 4,6-O-benzylidene-protected hemiacetals 8b and
10b under identical conditions gave anomeric mixtures, which
were recrystallized from n-hexane/acetone (4:1) to provide
pure α-phosphites 9b and 11b (Table 1). Tetramethylphos-

Having prepared 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl donors with a
phosphorus-containing leaving group, we initially explored
TMSOTf-promoted glycosylations of 1.1 equiv of 6-O-
unprotected glucoside 13 with 3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-protected
glucosyl donors 9a and 12 (Table 2). The reaction involved
the addition of a 1.0 M solution of TMSOTf (1.1 equiv) in
CH2Cl2 to a cooled mixture of a donor and 1.1 equiv of
acceptor 13.32 To date, glycosylations with 2-acetamido-2-
deoxyglycosyl donors have been performed at temperatures
above 0 °C. The reaction of phosphite 9a with alcohol 13 at 0
°C aﬀorded a mixture of β-linked disaccharide 14 and oxazoline
15 in a ratio of 0.3:1 as determined by 500 MHz 1H NMR
spectroscopic analysis of the crude mixture (entry 1). An
examination of
the reaction
demonstrated that a decrease in the reaction temperature is
increase in the yield of
accompanied by a signiﬁcant
disaccharide 14 (entries 1−3). The temperature limit
for
smooth reaction was −60 °C, at which β-linked disaccharide 14
was obtained in 36% yield (entry 3). Glycosylation with
phosphorodiamidate 12 proceeded at −45 °C to give almost
the same result (40% yield), but a protracted reaction time
(120 min) was required (entry 4). Given the diversity of
promoters available, the phosphite method was chosen for
further optimization. Due to its highly crystalline nature, diethyl
phosphite 9a is insoluble in solvents other than CH2Cl2 and
THF at −60 °C: exclusive formation of oxazoline 15 was
observed by the use of THF as a solvent (entry 5), and the
addition of either toluene or EtCN as a cosolvent aﬀorded no
discernible beneﬁt (entries 6 and 7 vs 3).

In an eﬀort to improve the chemical yield of disaccharide 14,
several promoters were screened in the reaction of diethyl
phosphite 9a with alcohol 13, and the results are compiled in
Table 3. Although the product ratio (14:15) was improved to
2:1,
in the
glycosylation with per-O-benzylated glycosyl diethyl phosphi-
tes,29a did not increase the yield of 14 due to the formation of a
number of byproducts. Of various metal triﬂates examined,33
34 were found to promote the reaction
Sn(OTf)2 and Hf(OTf)4
at −60 °C, aﬀording disaccharide 14 in 46% and 66% yields,
respectively. Since some Brønsted acids have been shown to
activate glycosyl phosphites,29b,35 our interest was then directed
to the use of promoters with Brønsted acidity. As expected
from the precedent,29c,d diethyl phosphite 9a could be activated
at lower temperature (−78 °C) with a variety of Brønsted acids
than with TMSOTf (entries 5−9). A signiﬁcantly longer
reaction time (12 h) was required to reach completion when
HClO4, prepared from t-BuBr and AgClO4 in toluene,36 was
employed as a promoter (entry 5). The reaction rate was
enhanced by the use of sulfonic acids in place of HClO4

Some Brønsted acids have been employed as catalysts to
activate glycosyl phosphites.35a,42 Therefore, we next inves-
tigated the glycosylation under catalytic conditions (Table 4).
In the presence of 0.2 equiv of Tf2NH, the glycosylation of
alcohol 13 with diethyl phosphite 9a did not proceed beyond a
50% conversion, providing disaccharide 14 in 22% yield (entry
1). We surmised that the result is attributed to the presence of
HP(O)(OEt)2 and oxazoline 15, which were formed as the
reaction progressed and would buﬀer
the
promoter. While the use of 0.5 equiv of Tf2NH was found to
be suﬃcient for the reaction to reach completion, product
selectivity (14:15) eroded signiﬁcantly (entry 2). Since an
excess amount of Tf2NH has essentially no eﬀect on the
reaction (entry 4), 1.1 equiv of Tf2NH was typically employed
for the glycosylation. The eﬀect of molar ratio of donor 9a and
acceptor 13 was also examined. When the amount of alcohol 13
used was increased from 1.1 to 2.0 equiv, higher yields were
obtained (entries 3 vs 5 and 6). The use of donor 9a in 2-fold
excess aﬀorded the best yield (93% yield, entry 7).43 These
results revealed the possibility that an excess of either reaction
component can be used depending on their availability.

Having optimized the reaction conditions, the scope of the
Tf2NH-promoted glycosylation was explored. Results of

5.44 As with donor 9a, glycosylation with 3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-
protected galactosyl diethyl phosphite 11a proceeded to
completion within 1 h to furnish disaccharide 16 in good
yields irrespective of the molar ratio (11a:13) used (entries 1
and 2). Consistent with a general trend of 4,6-O-benzylidene-
protected glycosyl donors exhibiting reduced reactivities,45
protracted reaction times were required for the complete
consumption of donors 9b and 11b (entries 3−6). The use of
glucosyl donor 9b was disappointing because the yields were
modest (up to 49%, entries 3 and 4). In stark contrast,
glycosylation with galactosyl donor 11b gave disaccharides 18
in good yields (entries 5 and 6). The diﬀerence in reactivity
between these donors may be explained by considering that
glucosyl donor 9b is a trans-fused bicyclic compound, whereas
galactosyl donor 11b has a relatively ﬂexible, cis-decaline-like
architecture. We speculate that
the greater conformational
rigidity of 9b relative to 11b facilitates oxazoline formation.46

groups further lowers the reactivity of donors, 3,4,6-tri-O-

As mentioned above, glycosylations with 2-acetamido-2-

higher than 0 °C due to the low reactivity of oxazolinium ion

reactive intermediates in Tf2NH-promoted reactions with 2-
acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl diethyl phosphites is suggested by
the following: (1) the reaction occurred at −78 °C and (2)
prolonged reaction times had no eﬀect on the yield of
disaccharides (eq 2). To validate this speculation, we ﬁrst

attempted glycosylation of alcohol 13 with oxazoline 15 in the

and 42 (entries 5 and 6). Glycosylation with α-thioglycoside 41
in CH2Cl2 at −78 °C required 18 h to reach completion,
whereas the reaction time was decreased to 6 h under identical
conditions when using β-thioglycoside 42. The diﬀerence in
reaction rate is a consequence of both the intramolecular
assistance of the neighboring acetamido group for elimination
of the β-oriented leaving group and the stability of the donor
stemming from the anomeric eﬀect. The intramolecular
assistance also facilitated formation of the oxazolinium ion,
thus leading to preferential production of oxazoline 15 from β-
thioglycoside 42. On the basis of these results, we concluded
that the oxazolinium ion formed from these donors is not
responsible for the glycosylation at a low temperature. These
experiments also indicate that the donors 40 and 41 have the
potential to be attractive alternatives to the phosphite 9a,
although the reaction conditions need to be optimized.

In 1997, Crich and Sun revealed on the basis of NMR
experiments that glycosyl triﬂates are cleanly generated from
the corresponding glycosyl sulfoxides even with participating
protecting groups at O-2 when treated with Tf2O in the
presence of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (DTBMP, eq
4).56 Stimulated by the pioneering work of Crich, considerable

eﬀorts have been devoted to clarify the mechanism of chemical
glycosylation reactions.57 Very recently, Crich, Pratt, and co-
workers suggested on the basis of computed and experimentally
determined primary 13C kinetic isotope eﬀect values that β-
glucoside formation occurs by an associative mechanism in
which the incoming alcohols displace the leaving group from α-
glucosyl triﬂates and/or α-contact ion pair (α-CIP).58 With
regard to the glycosylation with a participating group at O-2,
Yamago and co-workers proposed that glycosyl triﬂates exist in
equilibrium through neighboring group participation with
short-lived ionic intermediates, which react with alcohols
from the less hindered side to give 1,2-trans-glycosides, since
they monitored the formation of 2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-β-
glucosyl triﬂimide 46 from thioglycoside 45 (eq 5).59 This

Article

proposal seems to be supported by the predominant formation
of α-mannoside 52 from thioglycoside 49 (eq 6).60 On the
basis of these reports, we propose plausible reaction pathways
for the Tf2NH-promoted glycosylation with 2-acetamido-2-
deoxyglycosyl diethyl phosphites (Scheme 2).
<para sub=“ques”>
Upon activation by protonation of the phosphorus atom,61
diethyl phosphite is eliminated to generate an equilibrium
mixture of CIPs 6α and 6β, solvent-separated ion pair (SSIP)
55, and glycosyl triﬂimides 7α and 7β, whose equilibrium
would heavily lie to α-glycosyl triﬂimide 7α on kinetic and
thermodynamic grounds.62 The β-glycosyl
triﬂimide 7β
smoothly undergoes an intramolecular nucleophilic substitution
by the adjacent acetamido group, resulting in the exclusive
formation of oxazoline 3 through oxazolinium ion 2.
In
triﬂimide 7α would
contrast, α-CIP 6α and/or α-glycosyl
undergo nucleophilic attack by acceptor alcohols at
the
anomeric carbon from the β-face to provide β-glycosides 5
(path a). However, once the counterion is separated from 6α
and 7α, the acetamido oxygen atom can access the electrophilic
anomeric carbon along the stereoelectronically favored axial
direction to generate short-lived intermediate 57 as mentioned
by the Yamago group. Although the intramolecular reaction
that gives oxazoline 3 via oxazolinium ion 2 is energetically
favored compared to the intermolecular process, the possibility
of nucleophilic attack of acceptor alcohols from the less
hindered β-face of 57 leading to the formation of β-glycosides 5
cannot be excluded (path b). The fact that α-glycosides have
not been obtained reveals that the α-face of SSIP is completely
shielded by the acetamido group. SN2-like displacement of
protonated phosphite 54 with acceptor alcohols is also a
conceivable pathway for the formation of β-glycosides 5 (path
c).

While glycosyl

triﬂates and triﬂimides with participating
protecting groups at O-2 were cleanly generated as shown in
eqs 4−6, predominant formation of 1,2-trans-glycosides was
observed in all cases. Therefore,
it is not clear from these
precedents whether the glycosyl triﬂates/triﬂimides are actual
reactive species in glycosylation reactions, because nucleophilic
substitution of α-CIP, α-glycosyl triﬂate/triﬂimide, or short-
lived ionic intermediate resulting from neighboring group
participation provides β-glycosides in the gluco/galacto series.
Since intermediates are prone to oxazoline formation and are
labile and NMR experiments were therefore precluded in our
case,63 we decided to investigate the reactions with 2-
acetamido-2-deoxy-1-thiomannosides 58 and 59 in order to
gain an insight into the reaction pathways for glycosylation with
2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl donors.64

deoxymannosyl triﬂimide 70α would be formed through α-CIP

steric repulsion between the acetamido group disposed axially

of α-mannosidic linkages, the formation of thermodynamically

■ CONCLUSION
A direct construction of 1,2-trans-β-linked 2-acetamido-2-
deoxyglycosides using 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl donors
has been documented. Tf2NH was found to be the promoter
of choice for activation of diethyl phosphite donors, aﬀording
the corresponding β-glycosides in good to high yields with
complete stereoselectivity, albeit by the use of either a donor or
acceptor in 2-fold excess in most cases. It is noteworthy that
lowering the reaction temperature increased the yields of

Because of the alignment of the acetamido group anti to the
leaving group, α-thioglycoside 58 underwent cyclization (67α

isomer 59. The slightly higher α-selectivity observed with β-
thioglycoside 59 would be a result of the backside attack of
alcohol 13 on 67β (path c). From these results, we conclude
that the success of glycosylations at a low temperature is due to
the rate retardation of oxazolinium ion formation from α-
glycosyl

intermediates to react with acceptor alcohols.

glycosides. A wide range of glycosyl acceptors, including allyl
alcohols and some secondary alcohols as well as glycoside
alcohols bearing acid-sensitive acetal or epoxy groups, can be
employed in this coupling. While a limitation was encountered
with less reactive acceptor alcohols, such as 4- or 2-O-
unprotected glucosides, these results indicate the feasibility of
regioselective glycosylation of polyols. The glycosyl donor is
not conﬁned to highly reactive per-O-benzyl-protected 2-
acetamido-2-deoxyglucosyl and galactosyl diethyl phosphites,
and the scope of this reaction is extended to include less
reactive per-O-acetyl-protected 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl
diethyl phosphites and 4,6-O-benzylidene-protected galactosyl
diethyl phosphite as donors. The use of 2-acetamido-2-

Although the lability of intermediates precludes their direct
detection by NMR, some experiments provide strong evidence
that the corresponding oxazolinium ions are not responsible for
the reaction. On the basis of the literature reports by the groups
of Crich and Yamago, we propose a plausible reaction
mechanism in which β-glycosides are formed by SN2-like
displacement of α-glycosyl
triﬂimides and/or nucleophilic
attack from the less hindered face of α-CIP. The fact that the
acetamido group capable of anchimeric assistance behaves as a
nonparticipating group in the present glycosylation was
supported by the formation of a mixture of α- and β-
mannosides from 2-acetamido-2-deoxythiomannosides. The
reaction at a low temperature led to the rate retardation of
oxazolinium ion formation from α-glycosyl triﬂimides and α-
CIPs through their β-counterparts or SSIPs, thereby enabling
these intermediates to react with acceptor alcohols.

amido-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-β-D-glucopyranosyl)-2,3,4-
tri-O-benzyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (14).22c A 1.0 M solution of
Tf2NH in EtCN (0.11 mL, 0.11 mmol) was added to a cooled (−78
°C) mixture of diethyl phosphite 9a (61.2 mg, 0.10 mmol), 6-O-
unprotected glucoside 13 (51.2 mg, 0.11 mmol) and pulverized 4 Å
molecular sieves (61.2 mg) in CH2Cl2 (1.0 mL). After 1 h of stirring at
this temperature, the reaction was quenched with Et3N (0.15 mL).
The mixture was diluted with AcOEt (5 mL) and passed through a
Celite pad. The ﬁltrate was partitioned between AcOEt (15 mL) and
saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (6 mL). The organic layer was washed
with brine (6 mL), and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and
evaporation in vacuo furnished the crude products (138.5 mg), whose
ratio was determined to be 4.1:1 by 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopic
analysis. For easy puriﬁcation, a solution of the crude mixture in
AcOEt (10 mL) and CH2Cl2 (2 mL) was vigorously stirred with 10%
aqueous HCl (2 mL) for 10 min, during which time the oxazoline 15
was completely hydrolyzed to form the corresponding hemiacetal 8a.
The resulting mixture was extracted with AcOEt (6 mL), and the
organic extract was successively washed with saturated aqueous
NaHCO3 (6 mL) and brine (6 mL), and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4. Filtration and evaporation in vacuo followed by ﬂash column

(500 mg) in 1:1 CH2Cl2/Et2O (10 mL). After 5 h of stirring at this
temperature, the reaction was quenched with Et3N (0.4 mL), and the
mixture was poured into a two-layer mixture of Et2O (20 mL) and
10% aqueous NaOH (10 mL) and extracted with AcOEt (20 mL).
The organic extract was successively washed with brine (5 mL),
saturated aqueous NH4Cl (10 mL), and brine (10 mL) and dried over
anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and evaporation in vacuo furnished the
yellow oil (780 mg), which was puriﬁed by column chromatography
(silica gel 20 g, 7:1 n-hexane/AcOEt) to give an anomeric mixture of
the corresponding thioglycoside (534 mg, 85%, α:β = 60:40) as a
colorless oil.

Triphenylphosphine (269 mg, 1.45 mmol) was added to a stirred
solution of the 2-azido-2-deoxythioglycoside (530 mg, 0.93 mmol) in
THF (6 mL). After 30 min of stirring, H2O (1 mL) was added and the
mixture was heated at 80 °C for 10 h. The resulting mixture was
partitioned between AcOEt (30 mL) and brine (10 mL), and the
organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and
evaporation in vacuo furnished the 2-amino-2-deoxythioglycoside as a
colorless oil, which was dissolved in pyridine (5 mL). Ac2O (0.26 mL,
2.80 mmol) was added, and the solution was stirred for 3 h. The
reaction mixture was partitioned between AcOEt (30 mL) and 10%
aqueous HCl (15 mL). The organic layer was successively washed with
H2O (5 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (10 mL), and brine (10
mL), and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and evaporation in
vacuo furnished the crude product (801 mg, slightly yellow solid),
which was puriﬁed by ﬂash column chromatography (silica gel 50 g,
5:1 toluene/acetone) to give 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-thioglycoside 41
(288 mg, 53%) and its β-isomer 42 (193 mg, 35%) as white solids.

Methyl 6-O-(2-Acetamido-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-α-D-
mannopyranosyl)-2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (64)
and Methyl 6-O-(2-Acetamido-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-β-D-
mannopyranosyl)-2,3,4-tri-O-benzyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (65).
Tf2NH (1.0 M in EtCN, 0.09 mL, 0.09 mmol) was added to a cooled
(−60 °C) mixture of thioglycoside 58 (47.6 mg, 0.08 mmol), 6-O-
unprotected glucoside 13 (41.7 mg, 0.09 mmol), NIS (20.2 mg, 0.09

mmol), and pulverized 4 Å molecular sieves (82 mg) in CH2Cl2 (0.08
mL). After 14 h of stirring, the reaction was quenched with Et3N (0.1
mL), and the mixture was ﬁltrated through a Celite pad. The ﬁltrate
was partitioned between AcOEt (35 mL) and 20% aqueous Na2S2O3
(6 mL), and the organic layer was successively washed with 20%
aqueous Na2S2O3 (10 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (10 mL), and
brine (10 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and
evaporation in vacuo followed by gel permeation chromatography
(Bio-Beads S-X, toluene) aﬀorded a mixture of disaccharides 64 and
65 (12.1 mg, 16%, 64:65 = 62:38) as a colorless oil, along with
oxazoline 66 (31.3 mg, 81%) as a colorless oil. The ratio of
disaccharides 64 and 65 was determined by 500 MHz 1H NMR
spectroscopic analysis. The α- and β-glycosides were separated by
column chromatography (silica gel 1 g, 3:1 n-hexane/AcOEt). When
the glycosylation was performed employing thioglycoside 59 (60.8 mg,
0.10 mmol), 6-O-unprotected glucoside 13 (53.2 mg, 0.12 mmol),
NIS (25.9 mg, 0.12 mmol), pulverized 4 Å molecular sieves (100 mg),
and Tf2NH (1.0 M in EtCN, 0.12 mL, 0.12 mmol), a mixture of
disaccharides 64 and 65 (22.6 mg, 23%, 64:65 = 74:26) and oxazoline
66 (36.9 mg, 75%) were obtained as colorless oils from the crude
product (190 mg) after gel permeation chromatography (Bio-Beads S-
X, toluene).

(32) The low solubility of 2-acetamido-2-deoxyglycosyl donors in
CH2Cl2, together with the fact that the donors were immediately
converted to the corresponding oxazolines upon exposure to
promoters in the absence of acceptor alcohols, led us to pursue this
protocol.
(33) The reaction by La(OTf)3, Zn(OTf)2, CuOTf, Cu(OTf)2,
Y(OTf)3, Yb(OTf)3, or Mg(OTf)2 did not proceed at a temperature
below −23 °C and aﬀorded disaccharide 14 in low yield at higher
temperatures.

see: Sasaki, K.; Nagai, H.; Matsumura, S.; Toshima, K. Tetrahedron
Lett. 2003, 44, 5605−5608.
(40) An attempt to employ either Ts2NH or (MeSO2)2NH as a
promoter met with failure due to the poor solubility of
the
sulfonimides in CH2Cl2 or EtCN.
(41) TMSNTf2-promoted glycosylation of alcohol 13 with 9a
proceeded at −60 °C to give disaccharide 14 in 35% yield (reaction
time of 1 h, 14:15 = 0.7:1).

(43) The excess donor 9a was quantitatively converted to oxazoline
15, which could be recycled back to hemiacetal 8a upon exposure to
10% aq HCl/AcOEt/CH2Cl2 (1:5:1) at room temperature for 5 min.
(44) While we did not isolate byproducts, 1H NMR of the crude
mixture revealed the formation of oxazolines from excess donors.

(46) The diﬀerence in reactivity between 4,6-O-benzylidene-
protected donors has been reported by our laboratory.21b
(47) Since galactosyl donors 11a and 11b and 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-
protected glucosyl donor 9c were successfully employed,
the
glycosylation of alcohol 13 with 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-protected galactosyl
donor 11c has not been examined. The potential of donor 11c was
suﬃciently demonstrated by the coupling with alcohols 21 and 22
(Table 6).
(48) It was found that Tf2NH-promoted reaction of oxazoline 15
with alcohol 13 proceeded at temperatures above approximately 5 °C.
The addition of HP(O)(OEt)2, another product of the glycosylation
with glycosyl diethyl phosphites, was not eﬀective for the reaction.
(49) A similar level of downﬁeld shift was observed at −78 °C
despite low resolutions of the spectra.

(52) Donor 40 was prepared in 89% yield by the reaction of
hemiacetal 8a with Cl3CCN (1.6 equiv) in the presence of DBU (0.2
equiv) in CH2Cl2 for 1.5 h. Thioglycosides 41 and 42 were prepared
from 2-azido-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-D-glucosyl acetate53 by the
following three-step sequence: (1) PhSH (1.5 equiv), SnCl4 (1.1
equiv), 5 Å MS, CH2Cl2/Et2O (1:1), 5 h, 85%; (2) Ph3P (1.6 equiv),
THF/H2O (6:1), 80 °C, 10 h; (3) Ac2O (3 equiv), pyridine, 3 h, 53%
of α-isomer 41 (two steps), 35% of β-isomer 42 (two steps).

(63) While immediate formation of oxazoline from glycosyl diethyl
phosphite 9a could be observed in the NMR spectrum when treatment
with Tf2NH in CD2Cl2 at −78 °C, it was diﬃcult to characterize other
products including HP(O)(OEt)2 due to broadening of the peaks.
(64) An attempt to prepare 2-acetamido-3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-
α-D-mannosyl diethyl phosphite met with failure due to the
intramolecular assistance of the neighboring acetamido group for
elimination of the α-oriented leaving group.
