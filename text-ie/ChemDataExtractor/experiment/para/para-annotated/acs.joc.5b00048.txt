ABSTRACT: Peptoids constitute a class of peptidomimetics
with potential as protease resistant, biologically active ligands.
To harness the full potential of such compounds, however,
detailed predictive insight into their propensity to adopt well-
deﬁned secondary structures is highly desirable. In this work
we present an investigation of the eﬀects of thioamides and/or
ﬂuorides in peptoid monomer model systems using chemical
synthesis, NMR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. We
ﬁnd that the steric environment surrounding the tertiary amide
bonds is the key promoter of conformational preference, and X-ray crystallographic interrogation of our model systems did not
suggest the presence of stabilizing n → π* interactions unless the carbonyls were altered electronically by α-halogenation or
thioamide formation. In addition to the function as an investigative tool, these two types of modiﬁcation may thus be utilized as
stabilizers of secondary structure in future oligomer designs, such as the cis-amide-based polypeptoid helices that resemble the
polyproline type-I helix.

■ INTRODUCTION

Development of biopharmaceutical drugs and their approval by
governing agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration
in the United States has ﬂourished immensely in recent years.1
Monoclonal antibodies, proteins, and naturally occurring
peptides often exhibit highly potent and selective activities
with possible therapeutic beneﬁt, but
they are inherently
susceptible to proteolytic degradation, which causes a reduction
in half-life and eﬃcacy and hence increases the required dosage.
For these reasons, the ability to mimic or modify natural
peptide-based compounds has become highly desirable, and
one of
the many approaches pursued in the area of
peptidomimetics entails modiﬁcation of the peptide backbone
architecture to achieve resistance to proteases.2 Two prominent
examples of abiotic designs that exhibit high stability are the β-
peptides3 and peptoids4 (Chart 1), and both of these have
received considerable attention during the last two decades.
Both designs have been investigated as homooligomeric
constructs as well as in hybrid backbones containing canonical
α-amino acids or other residues,2c−e and recently β-amino acids
have been site-speciﬁcally incorporated in a therapeutic
polypeptide to increase pharmacokinetic properties in vivo,
demonstrating improvement of biopharmaceuticals through
backbone modiﬁcation.5

Access to structurally diverse peptoids through chemical
synthesis is inexpensive and highly eﬃcient,6 and since the ﬁrst

deﬁned conformations.16 Compared to peptides and β-
peptides, peptoids lack the ability to stabilize folding through
intramolecular hydrogen-bond networks and are also endowed
with an additional degree of ﬂexibility due to the low energy
barrier between cis and trans amide conformations of tertiary
amide bonds (Chart 1), as observed for proline residues in
native proteins.
Control of the cis−trans isomerization in peptoids has been
demonstrated by introduction of certain N-alkyl side chains that

this equilibrium toward either the cis or the trans
conformation.17−19 Due to interest in a backbone design called
β-peptoids20 (Chart 1), we reported a similar study of the eﬀect
of side chain structure in this system and furthermore included
thioamide and triﬂuoroacetyl modiﬁcations21 inspired by model
studies22,23 of proline behavior.24 Thionation and ﬂuorination
permutations may report on the nature of putative stereo-
electronic interactions and may also stabilize desired cis−trans
equilibria of tertiary amide bonds. A recent study provided

detailed insight into the eﬀect of thioacetylation in a range of
structurally diverse tertiary amides containing peptoid-derived
side chains,25 and the eﬀect on rotamer preference of tertiary
amides has been investigated by altering the acyl moiety as well,
including halogenation of the α-position of the acyl group.26
However, C-terminal amide groups were not included in these
studies, which prohibited interrogation of putative carbonyl−
carbonyl interactions. In the present work, we thus disclose the
ﬁrst systematic investigation of the eﬀects of thioamidation
and/or haloacetylation on cis−trans isomerism in α-peptoid
model
systems by using NMR spectroscopy and X-ray
crystallography.

■ RESULTS

Design and Synthesis. An initial compound collection was
designed to mimic the environment of a single peptoid residue
within an oligomer in a minimalistic manner. The C-termini
were therefore chosen to be dimethylamides, and the amide
bonds to be probed for cis−trans isomerism were based on
acetyl (3), triﬂuoroacetyl (4), or thioacetyl (5 prepared using
reagent 927) as outlined in Scheme 1. To examine putative
carbonyl−carbonyl interactions in both N → C and C → N
directions, we also included thioamides in the C-termini (7 and
8). These series were prepared from common intermediates
2a−e by thionation using Lawesson’s reagent28 to give 6a−e,
which were subsequently acylated (Scheme 1). Previous studies
of rotamer isomerism in proline model systems have primarily
focused on identifying the nature of trans carbonyl−carbonyl
interactions in the N → C direction (COi
···COi+1)22,23
due to the stabilizing eﬀect on protein folding.29 However,
since the two available X-ray crystal structures of oligomeric
peptoids revealed helical arrangements similar to the all-cis
polyproline type-I helix,12,13 we found it relevant to include
strongly cis-directing side chains such as (S)-1-(1-naphthyl)-
ethyl (s1npe; b) and tert-butyl (e) in our series. The full matrix
of compounds was prepared according to Scheme 1, except
compound 5e, for which several strategies failed to deliver the
target compound, presumably due to steric congestion.

Cis−Trans Equilibrium Constants Determined by 1H
NMR Spectroscopy. Measuring the cis−trans amide equili-
brium constants by NMR spectroscopy is straightforward as
integration of peaks from each conformation report quantita-
tively on their
relative concentrations. Because previous
evaluation of thioamide-containing peptoids revealed signiﬁcant
solvent eﬀects on cis−trans equilibria,21 it was decided to
record NMR spectra in four diﬀerent deuterated solvents of
varying polarities (Table 1). Rotating frame Overhauser eﬀect
spectroscopy (ROESY) and 1H−19F heteronuclear Overhauser
eﬀect spectroscopy (HOESY) experiments were performed in
order to assign the signals to the correct conformations (Figure
1).
<para sub=“props”>
First, compound 3a containing the (S)-1-phenylethyl (spe)
side chain, a well-studied moiety with respect to the folding
behavior of peptoids,14,30 showed data that were fully in
agreement with previously published studies.18 Furthermore,
the more sterically demanding s1npe-containing side chain in
compound 3b showed trends that were in accordance with
previously reported data obtained for similar compounds based
on both peptoids18 and β-peptoids.21 There was a signiﬁcant
preference for
four solvents,
increasing in the order CDCl3 < D2O < CD3OD < CD3CN.

increase in Kcis/trans
in all solvents, albeit to a lesser extent.
Interestingly, when comparing spe and bnz groups in β-peptoid
model systems, similar Kcis/trans values were observed.21 This
indicates that the increased population of the cis conformation
in bnz-containing α-peptoids is due to steric rather than
electronic eﬀects. Moreover, when we replaced the phenyl
groups of 3c with methyl groups (3d) we observed a change of
preference to the trans rotamer, which supports the notion that
the main driving force is of a steric nature. Finally, introduction
of the bulky tert-butyl N-alkyl group (3e) gave exclusively the
cis conformation (Kcis/trans > 20) at our level of detection, which
is also in agreement with previously published data.19
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Introduction of a triﬂuoroacetyl group should make the
carbonyl carbon more electron deﬁcient due to the inductive
eﬀect of the ﬂuorines. It is furthermore known that the ﬂuorine
lone pairs can donate electron density into the π* orbital of the
adjacent carbonyl group if ideally positioned.31 On the other
hand, the triﬂuoromethyl group resembles an isobutyl group in
size,23 giving rise to simultaneous steric and electronic eﬀects
that may complicate the interpretation of the driving forces
behind the conformational changes. Since compound 4b
showed an increase in Kcis/trans value compared to 3b, while
compounds 4a, 4c, and 4d showed a decrease, we indeed
suspect that there are diﬀerential forces at play depending on
the speciﬁc structures of the model systems.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Raines and co-workers studied carbonyl−carbonyl

inter-
actions in proline model systems by substituting oxygen atoms
with sulfur to increase the nucleophilicity of
the putative
carbonyl donor.22 Inspired by these studies, we investigated
both N- and C-terminal thioamide-containing model systems
individually. The thioacetylated compounds 5a−e displayed
roughly the same trends as their acetylated counterparts (3a−
e). This indicates that there are negligible contributions from
the n → π* interaction in the N → C direction in this series.
The C-terminal thioamide series (7a−e), on the other hand,
displayed slightly higher Kcis/trans values compared to the C-
terminal oxoamide series as well as the (O,O)-series (3), except
for the s1npe-containing compounds 5b and 7b, where the
trend was opposite (Table 1). The latter would agree with a
stabilizing eﬀect between the sulfur and a C(sp2)−H on the
naphthyl ring in 5b as previously indicated for β-peptoids.21

<para sub=“props”>
The attenuated hydrogen-bond acceptor capability of the
triﬂuoroacetyl group correlates with an upﬁeld shift of this
proton (Supporting Information Figure S1). On the other
hand, the thioacetyl group gave rise to a slight downﬁeld shift as
previously rationalized by NBO calculations of similar β-
peptoids to arise from increased orbital overlap.21 Furthermore,
Kcis/trans values of 3a−e determined in CDCl3 were generally
higher than those of both 5a−e and 7a−e and were lower or
similar when recorded in CD3OD and CD3CN, except for 7b in
CD3CN. Overall,
solvent eﬀects between
compound series results in diﬃculty in deriving truly general
trends regarding the Kcis/trans values across all compounds in all

Three X-ray diﬀraction structures of

s1npe-containing
compounds were solved, and all
showed a cis amide
conformation consistent with the obtained Kcis/trans values in
solution (Figure 1).
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
The distances between the C-terminal carbonyl heteroatoms
and the carbon of the N-terminal carbonyls were consistent
with an orbital overlap in all cases, but the angles were 14−19°
higher than the optimal Bürgi−Dunitz trajectory of 107°, and
the degree of pyramidalization (Δ) was relatively low (Table 2)
compared to values found in proline model systems.32 In
agreement with our previous studies,21 the distance between
the hydrogen atom in the 8 position of the naphthyl group and
the thiocarbonyl in compound 5b (Figure 2B) was consistent
with an aromatic C−H···Samide
interaction. This potential
interaction is also observed in the two other compounds
(Figure 2A and 2C). Notably, the longer interaction distances
of the sulfur of 0.2−0.3 Å compared to oxygen is in agreement
with the larger van der Waals radius (1.80 and 1.52 Å,
respectively). The close proximity of the side chain methine
hydrogen and the carbonyl in the crystal structures are also
consistent with the chemical shifts in 1H NMR discussed above.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Gratifyingly, we were also able to obtain X-ray diﬀraction
quality crystals of the entire bnz series, 3c−8c (Figure 3A−E).
Compounds 3c, 4c, 7c, and 8c crystallized in the cis
conformation, while the X-ray diﬀraction crystal structure of
5c was in the trans conformation. Comparing the acetylated
compounds (3c and 7c) with their triﬂuoroacetylated analogues
(4c and 8c),
the triﬂuoroacetylated compounds displayed

trajectory angles closer to the Bürgi−Dunitz angle and also
showed signiﬁcantly increased pyramidalization (Table 2).
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
This correlates with an improved acceptor character of the
triﬂuoroacetyl group compared to acetyl. Interestingly, ω angles
of the triﬂuoroacetylated model compounds deviated signiﬁ-
cantly from planarity compared to their acetylated analogues,
which indicates a steric inﬂuence of the triﬂuoromethyl group
in the cis conformation as well. Thus, common for the four
crystal structures that exhibit cis conformation (Figure 3A, B,
D, and E) is packing of the backbone with one of the phenyl
rings of the bnz group, which reduces its ﬂexibility and ability to
point away from the bulk of the triﬂuoromethyl group in
compounds 4c and 8c (see, Figure 3F for example).
Furthermore, the distribution of steric bulk across the two
side chains in bnz results in altered χ angles in all examples
where increased bulk (ﬂuorination and/or
thionation) is
introduced into the backbone (Table 2). Finally, in agreement
with the presence of n → π* interactions with C → N
directionality, the C-terminal thioamide-containing compounds
exhibited angles closer to 107° and stronger pyramidalization
than their C-terminal oxoamide analogues (Table 2).
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
The trans amide conformation of compound 5c showed
distances indicating possible carbonyl−carbonyl interactions in
both N → C and C → N directions, which could help explain
its preferred crystallization in this conformation. However,
inspection of the geometry in this crystal structure revealed
trajectory angles and pyramidalization in poor agreement with n
→ π* interactions (Table 2). Nevertheless, since 5c was
crystallized by vapor diﬀusion from chloroform it could be
reasoned that the trans conformation in the crystal is due to its
conformational preference in this solvent as indicated by the
NMR analyses above (Table 1).

We also acquired two crystal structures with the spe side
chain (4a and 8a), which both crystallized in the trans
conformation as would be expected based on their Kcis/trans
values. Notably, even though compound 8a contains the
donor−acceptor pair identiﬁed above to be most likely to
engage in an n → π* interaction, the trajectory angle and
pyramidalization do not indicate the presence of a particularly
strong interaction (Table 2; please consult the Supporting

Dihalogenated Acyl Compounds (10−15). To further
investigate stereoelectronic versus steric eﬀects in haloacety-
lated compounds, we prepared a selection of dihaloacetylated
peptoid model compounds shown in Figure 4A. In a study by
Raines and co-workers,23,33 the donor capability of the carbonyl
in mono-, di-, and triﬂuoroacetyl groups was investigated,
whereas the acceptor capacity is under scrutiny here. We chose
benzhydryl (10−12) and s1npe (13 and 14) as side chains and
also included compound 15 with an isopropyl side chain to test
if these backbone modiﬁcations would be able to shift the
preference from trans to cis conformation.
<para sub=“props”>
Interestingly, the diﬂuoroacetylated compounds (10 and 12−
15) all showed higher Kcis/trans values than their triﬂuoroacety-
lated counterparts (Figure 4B). When introducing the
dichloroacetyl group, preference for the cis conformation was
even more pronounced than diﬂuoro- or triﬂuoroacetyl (11 vs

4c and 10). This strongly suggests a predominant steric eﬀect
of the two chlorine atoms since the inductive potency should
be lower than that of ﬂuorine and should therefore give rise to
lower Kcis/trans.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
The steric eﬀect is further supported by the X-ray diﬀraction
crystal structure of 11 where the CH of the dichloromethyl
group is close to antiperiplanar in relation to the carbonyl (τ
angle in Table 3), pointing the chlorines away from the
backbone (Figure 4C). This will also disfavor the donation of
chlorine lone pairs into the π* orbital of the adjacent carbonyl
to attenuate its acceptor capacity for possible carbonyl−
carbonyl n → π* interactions.31,33,34 The same was observed in
both crystal structures of diﬂuoroacetylated compounds 10 and
12 (Figure 4C and Table 3). Compound 12 exhibited the
highest degree of pyramidalization as well as a trajectory angle
that was closer to 107° than the other two compounds, thus
adhering to the same trend as observed for 4c vs 8c.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Compounds 13 and 14 also exhibited increased Kcis/trans
values in all solvents compared to their triﬂuoroacetylated
homologues 3b and 7b, respectively (Figure 4B). Although the
backbone would not be as rotationally restricted as in the
benzhydryl case discussed above, this observation correlates
with favorable accommodation of the diﬂuoromethyl group
compared to the triﬂuoromethyl group toward the backbone
face. Interestingly, however, the ϕ and ψ angles of compound
13 showed opposite signs compared to all other

indicated above to promote a carbonyl−carbonyl n → π*
interaction in the C → N direction. The increase in Kcis/trans
observed for 14 compared to 13 is also in agreement with such
an interaction. The X-ray diﬀraction crystal structures revealed
carbonyl−carbonyl distances in agreement with orbital overlap
and pyramidalization indicative of n → π* interaction in the C

13 and 14 diﬀered by 26° and 15° from the ideal Bürgi−Dunitz

Finally, compound 15 revealed an increased fraction of cis

Triﬂuoroacetylation (4d and 8d) resulted in a slight decrease in
Kcis/trans values, while diﬂuoroacetylation furnished an increase
in Kcis/trans, which again is
in agreement with favorable
accommodation of
the less hindered diﬂuoromethyl group
toward the backbone in the cis conformation. Moreover, a
carbonyl−carbonyl interaction as observed for compound 12
may add to the stabilization of this conformation, but we do not
have X-ray diﬀraction data to support this.

albeit with subtle eﬀects of altering carbonyls by thioamide
substitution. However, the less bulky bnz side chain, which
more readily adopts both conformations in a solvent-dependent
manner, allowed for a more detailed inspection of the eﬀect of
the electronic properties of the carbonyl groups (3c−8c and
10−12). In particular, the X-ray diﬀraction structures of the N-
terminally haloacetylated model systems with a C-terminal
thioamide, which should provide a strong acceptor−donor pair,
showed pyramidalization and trajectory angles in agreement
with n → π* interactions. The X-ray diﬀraction crystal

triﬂuoroacetylated compounds (4c and 8c)
structures of
obtained in the cis conformation showed clear evidence of
steric eﬀects as the amides were twisted out of the planarity
preferred for amide bonds. In addition, the data obtained for
dihaloacetylated model systems (10, 11, and 12) support the
argument of steric congestion between the backbone and the
haloacetyl group by displaying higher Kcis/trans values. This could
be explained by conformations where the single hydrogen of
the dihalomethyl groups faces the backbone, which is indeed
the case in the crystal structures of 10−12 where the
dihaloacetyl groups adopt near antiperiplanar conformations.
The data thus suggest that when the steric environment allows
for it, carbonyl−carbonyl interactions can be optimized to aﬀect
conformational space.

<para sub=“props”>
The steric eﬀect of

the side chain in response to
triﬂuoroacetylation becomes less prominent in the spe and iPr
series, where the cis−trans equilibrium is signiﬁcantly shifted
toward the trans conformation. Interestingly, the diﬂuoroacety-
lated compound 15 displays opposite conformational prefer-
ence than its triﬂuoroacetylated analog (8d) in MeOH and
MeCN. Since there is no steric argument for a cis preference of
15, this also supports that, when sterically allowed, stereo-
the carbonyl−carbonyl
electronic eﬀects in the form of
interactions may aﬀect conformational preference in peptoids.
On the basis of the qualitative relationship between the
strength of a potential n → π* interaction and the degree of
pyramidalization of the carbonyl acceptor, the crystal structures
of the bnz series provide insight into the stereoelectronic eﬀects
of our various modiﬁcations. Improving the carbonyl acceptor
by triﬂuorination (4c) signiﬁcantly enhances the character of a
putative n → π* interaction, while enhanced carbonyl donor
capacity in a thioamide (7c) results in an improved trajectory
angle but modest pyramidalization. Combination of the two
modiﬁcations (8c), however, gives rise to a trajectory close to
the Bürgi−Dunitz angle as well as the highest degree of
acceptor pyramidalization observed in all our X-ray diﬀraction
crystal structures.
</para>
In summary, we systematically investigated the conforma-
tional preference in an array of structurally diverse α-peptoid
(N-alkylglycine) model systems using NMR spectroscopy as
well as X-ray crystallography of more than a dozen of the model
compounds. Collectively, our data show no evidence for a
general stabilizing eﬀect of trans amide bonds by n → π*
interactions
in peptoids, which, compared to proline
systems,22,23,29 may arise from the increased ﬂexibility of the
acyclic peptoids under investigation herein. Nevertheless, we
see strong evidence for the ability to promote such interactions
in the C → N direction in cis-conﬁgured peptoids by altering
the electronic properties of the donor and acceptor carbonyls,
respectively. Whereas compelling evidence for an n → π*
aryl
interaction between a carbonyl
lone pair and a positively
charged triazolium side chain has been reported for peptoids,19
the present work provides the ﬁrst demonstration of subtle
backbone modiﬁcations (α-ﬂuorination and thioamidation)
that may stabilize certain peptoid conformations. On the basis
of the complete body of data, we therefore propose a model for
the factors aﬀecting conformational space in peptoids that is
ﬁrst and foremost dependent on sterics but may include
stabilizing eﬀects of carbonyl−carbonyl
interactions in elec-
tronically altered systems.

Thioamide substitution has been shown to aﬀect

the
equilibrium between α- and 310-helices in peptides,35 and we
thus envision that the insights provided herein may be utilized

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
<para sub=“exp”>
General. All chemicals were analytical grade and used without
further puriﬁcation. All reactions were performed in dry solvents and
under argon atmosphere. Dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and toluene were retrieved from a
solvent puriﬁcation system, and EtOAc was dried over molecular
sieves (4 Å). Vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC) puriﬁcation was
performed on silica gel 60 (particle size 0.015−0.040 μm). UPLC−MS
analyses were performed using an ultra-high-performance liquid
chromatography system. A gradient with eluent I (0.1% HCOOH in
water) and eluent II (0.1% HCOOH in MeCN) rising linearly from
0% to 95% of II during t = 0.00−2.50 min was applied at a ﬂow rate of
0.6 mL/min (gradient A) or during t = 0.00−5.20 min (gradient B).
Compounds, which were not obtained in suﬃcient purity by VLC,
were puriﬁed by preparative HPLC performed on a 250 mm × 20 mm,
C18 column (5 μm, 100 Å) using a diode array UV detector. A
gradient C with eluent III [95:5:0.1, water−MeCN−triﬂuoroacetic
acid (TFA)] and eluent IV (0.1% TFA in MeCN) rising linearly from
0% to 95% of IV during t = 5−45 min was applied at a ﬂow rate of 20
mL/min. All ﬁnal compounds were determined by analytical HPLC
analysis to be >95% pure on a 150 mm × 4.6 mm, C18 column (3 μm)
using a multiwavelength UV detector. The gradient consisted of eluent
III (95:5:0.1, water−MeCN−TFA) and eluent IV (0.1% TFA in
MeCN) rising linearly from 0% to 95% of IV during t = 2−20 min at a
ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min (gradient D; data not shown). NMR chemical
shifts are reported in ppm relative to deuterated solvent peaks as
internal standards (δH, D2O 4.79 ppm; δH, CD3OD 3.31 ppm; δH,
CD3CN 1.94 ppm; δH, CDCl3 7.26 ppm; δC, CDCl3 77.16 ppm).
Coupling constants (J) are given in hertz (Hz). Multiplicities of NMR
signals are reported as follows: s, singlet; br s, broad singlet; d, doublet;
t, triplet; q, quartet; sept, septet; m, multiplet. Signals in the NMR data
marked with an asterisk correspond to peaks assigned to the minor
rotamer conformation and (*) denotes peaks where both rotamers
overlap. The HRMS spectra were recorded using either matrix-assisted
laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) or electrospray ionization (ESI)
as indicated for each compound with Fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance (FT-ICR) as mass analyzer.

2-Bromo-N,N-dimethylacetamide (1). Bromoacetyl bromide

General Procedure for Di- and Triﬂuoroacetylation. Di- or
triﬂuoroacetic anhydride (3 equiv) was added dropwise to a solution of
secondary amine (2 or 6; 1 equiv) and Et3N (3 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (to
give a 0.4 M solution with respect to the amine) at 0 °C. The reaction
mixture was then stirred for 2−18 h (monitored by TLC) at rt, poured
into saturated aqueous NaHCO3, and extracted with EtOAc (3×). The
combined organic phases were dried (NaSO4), ﬁltered, and
concentrated in vacuo. The crude products were puriﬁed by VLC.

Procedure for Synthesis of Thioacetylation Reagent 9. The
synthesis was adapted from the reported procedure by Doszczak and
Rachon.27 P2S5 (11.2 g, 25 mmol) was suspended in toluene (70 mL),
2,2-dimethylpropane-1,3-diol (10.4 g, 100 mmol) was added, and the
mixture was heated to 80 °C overnight. The reaction was cooled to rt
and ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was concentrated, and the crude was
recrystallized from CCl4 (25 mL). After
letting the compound
precipitate in the freezer (−18 °C) for 6 h, the solvent was removed by
ﬁltration and the colorless crystals were dried in vacuo to give 16 (13.0
g, 66%). Compound 16 (1.98 g, 10 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2
(30 mL), and acetyl chloride (710 μL, 10 mmol) was added at rt. The
mixture was cooled to 0 °C, and Et3N (1.4 mL, 10 mmol) was added
dropwise. The reaction was stirred at 0 °C for 15 min followed by 15
min at rt. The mixture was then ﬁltered through a pad of silica gel, and
the ﬁltrate was concentrated in vacuo to give 17 (1.75 g, 73%).
Compounds 16 (2.78 g, 14 mmol) and 17 (1.7 g, 7 mmol) were then
dissolved in toluene (50 mL) and heated to 90 °C for 2.5 h, at which
point the solution turned red. The solution was allowed to cool to rt,
and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The crude was dissolved in
CH2Cl2 (50 mL), washed with satd aq NaHCO3 and water. The
organic phase was dried (MgSO4), ﬁltered, and concentrated in vacuo
to give 9 (1.52 g, 85%), which was used without further puriﬁcation.
General Procedure for Thioacetylation. A solution of 2a−e (1
equiv) and pyridine (1 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (0.7 M) was added dropwise
to thioacetylation reagent 9 (0.9 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (0.2 M) at rt. After
stirring for 1 h the reaction mixture was washed with satd aq NaHCO3
and water. The organic phase was dried (MgSO4), ﬁltered, and
concentrated in vacuo. The crude product was puriﬁed by VLC.

X-ray Crystallography. All ﬁnal compounds were subjected to
vapor diﬀusion crystallization with chloroform as solvent and pentane
as precipitant. Compounds unsuccessful
to this method were
attempted crystallized by slow evaporation from solubility compatible
solvents (e.g., chloroform, EtOAc, CH2Cl2, or acetone). Compounds
7c and 10 were crystallized by slow evaporation from acetone and 12
by slow evaporation from chloroform. X-ray diﬀraction proﬁle data
from ω scans were collected on using Cu Kα radiation. Data was
processed and scaled using the CrysAlisPro software [Version
1.171.36.28 (released Jan 02, 2013 CrysAlis171.NET)]. Details of
the data collection are found in the supplementary CIF ﬁles. All crystal
structures were solved using SHELXS and reﬁned using SHELXL37,38
in the OLEX2 interface.38 Hydrogen atoms were observed and
included on ideal positions using riding coordinates.
