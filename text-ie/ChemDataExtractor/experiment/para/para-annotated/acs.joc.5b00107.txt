ABSTRACT: Short total syntheses of arnottin I and II were accomplished in 5 and 6 steps, respectively. A sesamol-benzyne
cycloaddition with a 3-furyl-benzoate followed by regiospeciﬁc lactonization provided rapid, large-scale access to the core of
arnottin I. Saponiﬁcation of arnottin I and hypervalent iodide mediated spirocyclization provided an eﬃcient and direct
preparation of racemic arnottin II.

T he arnottins (I and II) are coumarin-type natural products

isolated from the bark of the Xanthoxylum arnottianum
Maxim (rutaceae) and are surmised to possess antibiotic
properties.1 Syntheses of these interesting metabolites have
been reported after
isolation and structural
determination.2 The absolute stereochemical conﬁguration of
spirocyclic arnottin II was
synthetically determined via
asymmetric dihydroxylation of a reduced isomer of arnottin I
by Yamaguchi and co-workers.2c

the initial

Scheme 1. Preparation of Arnottin I

Tandem oxidative dearomatization and spirocyclization3 is
capable of converting simple benzocoumarins
to chiral
spirocyclic lactones that are found in several natural product
families. The direct conversion of arnottin I to arnottin II using
this method has not yet been reported. Hypervalent iodide
mediated oxidative dearomatization has been employed in the
synthesis of various natural products including galanthamine
and other amaryllidaceae alkaloids.4,5 Recent advances have
allowed for asymmetric hypervalent iodide oxidative dearoma-
tization;6,7 however, few examples exist within total synthesis.
To study and expand upon current methods for hypervalent
iodide mediated spirocyclization, a short and concise synthesis
of the arnottins was pursued. The preparation of arnottin I
utilized a benzyne cycloaddition, hydrolysis, and oxidative
spirocyclization to arnottin II to provide large quantities of the
metabolites for testing.
<para sub="scope">
A convergent synthetic path to arnottin I was planned using a
benzyne cycloaddition with a 3-furyl benzoate, followed by
lactone formation (Scheme 1). Bis-lithiation of 6-bromosesa-
mol,8 followed by trimethylsilyl chloride quench and triﬂation
using under Mori’s procedure9 aﬀorded benzyne precursor 4 in
74% overall yield on 5 g scale. The furyl coupling partner was

prepared from readily available dimethoxybenzoic acid and
converted to either the methyl (5a) or tert-butyl bromoester
(5b) in 2 steps.2c The bromoester (5) was cross-coupled under
Suzuki’s condition with commercially available 3-furylboronic
acid in 82 and 96% yield for the methyl and tert-butyl ester,
respectively. The benzyne-mediated cycloaddition proved
capricious and required the sesamol silyltriﬂate to be used in
excess (1.4 equiv) with slow generation of the benzyne using
weakly soluble CsF in acetonitrile. The in situ cycloaddition
produced the arnottin I progenitors (rac-7a, rac-7b) in 66 and
64% yield, respectively.

<para sub="scope">
Unsaturated bicyclic ethers, such as 7, can be converted to
naphthols under a variety of conditions including Bronsted
acids,10 ruthenium,11 rhodium,12 and aluminum complexes.13
The naphthol regioisomer produced is less predictable and was
unknown for structure 7 at the onset of these studies. For the
transformation of esters rac-7a and rac-7b to 1, several
conditions were attempted: Lewis acids such as BF3-etherate
or Sc(OTf)3 gave complex mixtures and nucleophiles such as
NaI and NaBr resulted in degradation. Bronsted acids were
most eﬀectual with HCl and TsOH both providing arnottin I
for rac-7a and rac-7b in diﬀering yield. Exposure of methyl ester
rac-7a to TsOH in methanol led to nonregiospeciﬁc naphthol
formation resulting in both arnottin I (15%) and the 4-
naphthol derivative 8.14 Identical reaction conditions were
attempted with tert-butyl ester rac-7b and surprisingly led to
clean conversion of arnottin I in 92% yield with no 4-naphthol
derivative observed. The synthetically prepared arnottin I
displayed spectroscopic and physical properties identical to the
natural product.1 The disparity in reaction yield between rac-7a
and rac-7b to arnottin I and the absent 4-naphthol derivative in
the rac-7b reaction suggests the mechanism follows diﬀerent
paths for each ester employed. The methyl ester (rac-7a)
produced both arnottin I and the 4-naphthol derivative
suggesting naphthol formation occurred with little regiospeci-
ﬁcity. The resultant 1-naphthol produced arnottin I whereas the
4-naphthol was incapable of cyclization. The tert-butyl ester
(rac-7b) cleanly aﬀorded arnottin I, suggesting the ester is
deprotected prior
formation. One plausible
mechanism is the weakening of a tert-butyl ester proton due
to carbonyl lone-pair donation into the C−O σ* of the bicycle,
resulting in loss of
isobutylene and carboxylate promoted
rupture of the allylic ether as shown by intermediate 9 (Figure
1). The resultant benzylic alcohol (10) is quickly dehydrated to

to naphthol

Isobutylene was not observed; however, volatility would make
detection diﬃcult. The fortuitous sequence aﬀorded large
quantities of arnottin I and allowed the study of conversion to

Saponiﬁcation of arnottin I required immediate exposure to

The saponiﬁed phenol acid was immediately exposed to
diﬀerent hypervalent iodide conditions to eﬀect the spirocyc-
lization. The highly reactive bis(triﬂuoroacetoxy)iodobenzene
(PIFA) was necessary to form racemic arnottin II in DCM with
cesium carbonate as an additive in 23% yield (Table 1, entry 1).

<para sub=“opt”>
Kita noted substantial
increases in yield using ﬂuorinated
solvents10 that were also investigated. Triﬂuoroethanol (TFE,
entry 2, 25%) was inferior as compared to hexaﬂuoroisopro-
panol (HFIP, entry 3, 40%) as solvent. Blends of DCM and
HFIP (entry 4, 28%) did not oﬀer enhanced yields. An
intensely colored intermediate was formed over the ﬁrst 20 min
of the reaction and persisted throughout the duration of the
reaction. Two possible intermediates could exist; a ligand
exchanged trapped γ3-iodane 11, or a dissociated cationic
complex 12.4b We reasoned the breakdown of
the mixed
hypervalent intermediate could occur through liberation of the
weaker carboxylate donor using a nucleophilic donor. DMAP
(entry 5) was added to the reaction, but did not increase the
yield substantially as compared to its absence (entry 3).
Perchlorate salts, known to increase yields
involving
nucleophilic addition to phenoxenium radical cations,15 also
did not improve the reaction and had noted degradation (entry
6). Slow addition of PIFA over 1 h provided a boost in yield
and generated arnottin II in 56% overall yield over the two
steps (entry 7). Attempts at asymmetric spirocyclization using
chiral hypervalent iodide sources are planned.
</para>
In conclusion, we developed an eﬃcient route from readily
available materials to the arnottins using a benzyne cyclo-
addition and regiospeciﬁc ether fragmentation−lactonization
cascade. Several other coumarin based natural products can
now be accessed more eﬃciently using this tactic.
