ABSTRACT: We report here the synthesis and characterization of
BODIPY−chlorin arrays containing a chlorin subunit, with tunable
deep-red (641−685 nm) emission, and one or two BODIPY moieties,
absorbing at 504 nm. Two types of arrays were examined: one where
BODIPY moieties are attached through a phenylacetylene linker at the
13- or 3,13-positions of chlorin, and a second type where BODIPY is
attached at the 10-position of chlorin through an amide linker. Each of
the examined arrays exhibits an eﬃcient (≥0.80) energy transfer from
BODIPY to the chlorin moiety in both toluene and DMF and exhibits
intense ﬂuorescence of chlorin upon excitation of BODIPY
at ∼500 nm. Therefore, the eﬀective Stokes shift in such arrays is
in the range of 140−180 nm. Dyads with BODIPY attached at the 10-
position of chlorin exhibit a bright ﬂuorescence in a range of solvents
with diﬀerent polarities (i.e., toluene, MeOH, DMF, and DMSO). In
contrast to this, some of the arrays in which BODIPY is attached at the 3- or at both 3,13-positons of chlorin exhibit signiﬁcant
reduction of ﬂuorescence in polar solvents. Overall, dyads where BODIPY is attached at the 10-position of chlorin exhibit ∼5-
fold brighter ﬂuorescence than corresponding chlorin monomers, upon excitation at 500 nm.

■ INTRODUCTION

Hydroporphyrins (chlorins and bacteriochlorins) are tetrapyrrolic
macrocycles, which oﬀer unique beneﬁts for in vivo ﬂuorescence
imaging. They possess multiple absorption bands, e.g., the deep-
red or near-IR Qy band (650−700 nm for chlorins, 700−800 nm
for bacteriochlorins), the Qx band, which is located in the green
range (500−520 nm), and B bands, which are located in the violet
or UV spectral windows (400−430 nm for chlorins, 360−380 nm
for bacteriochlorins).1−4 Excitation at each of these absorption
bands results in an emission in the deep-red (chlorin, 630−700 nm)
or the near-IR (bacteriochlorin, 720−800 nm) spectral windows.
Another beneﬁcial feature of hydroporphyrins is their narrow
(with full-width at half-width-at-half-of-maximum ∼12−20 nm)
emission bands. Additionally, wavelengths of absorption and
emission maxima for hydroporphyrins can be precisely tuned
the macrocycles.2−5
by substitution on the periphery of
Both the latter properties should greatly facilitate applications
of hydroporphyrins as ﬂuorophores for multicolor imaging.
Recently, our collaborative eﬀorts have demonstrated that
unique properties of hydroporphyrins are highly beneﬁcial for
construction of ﬂuorescent probes for anticancer ﬂuorescence-
guided surgery.6,7 It has been shown that, upon excitation with
the green light (∼510 nm), a probe containing bacteriochlorin
as a ﬂuorophore results in near-IR emission (760 nm) with a
large pseudo-Stokes shift (250 nm) and produces a very sharp
near-IR image of target tumors located on the tissue surface,
with a high tumor-to-background ratio.6 This is apparently due

to the large Stokes shift, which enables detection of a near-IR
emission far from the excitation beam. As a result, both back-
ground ﬂuorescence and detection of scattered light from the
excitation source are diminished. Due to very shallow tissue pen-
etration, green light is unable to excite ﬂuorophores localized deeper
in the tissue; these can only be detected and visualized upon exci-
tation with the near-IR wavelengths. However, near-IR excitation,
due to the small Stokes shift (∼10 nm) and tissue autoﬂuorescence,
produces blurred images with a tumor-to-background ratio lower
than that observed for green excitation. Nevertheless, near-IR
excitation can instead be used for detection of tumors localized
below the tissue surface (or hidden behind mesentery or intestines),
while green excitation can be used for precise determination of
tumor margins. This “double-excitation” approach is not possible
with ﬂuorophores typically used for near-IR imaging (such as
cyanines), since the latter do not possess an appreciable absor-
bance in the green spectral window.6 Typical organic near-IR
ﬂuorophores usually exhibit a single, relatively narrow absorption
−S1 absor-
band in the near-IR spectral window, due to their S0
−S2 absorption is
ption, and their band corresponding to S0
located in the UV spectral window (with λ < 400 nm).8

Subsequently,

it has also been demonstrated that hydro-
porphyrins can be used for simultaneous visualization of two
diﬀerent cancer cells in vivo due to their narrow and tunable

emission bands.7 Chlorins and bacteriochlorins have also been
utilized by other groups for intracellular and in vivo ﬂuorescence
or photoaccoustic imaging.9,10

One of the limitations, which potentially might hamper the
full exploitation of hydroporphyrins’ properties in ﬂuorescence-
guided surgery, is the relatively low extinction coeﬃcient for the
Qx band (∼500 nm), which is in the range of ∼8000−13 000 M−1·
cm−1 for chlorins,11 and 35 000−39 000 M−1·cm−1 for bacterio-
chlorins.12 These values are substantially lower in comparison
to typical ﬂuorophores used in ﬂuorescence imaging (>100 000
M−1·cm−1) and results in substantially lower ﬂuorescence bright-
ness upon visible excitation (for a compilation of the brightness
of typical near-IR ﬂuorophores see ref 13).
We propose to increase the ﬂuorescence brightness of
hydroporphyrins, upon excitation at ∼500 nm, by utilizing an
auxiliary chromophore, strongly absorbing in the green region,
and capable of transferring excitation energy to hydroporphyrins.
Hydroporphyrins in energy transfer arrays might function as
both energy donors and acceptors, which was utilized in the
construction of arrays with potential biomedical or energy-
related applications.9,14−22 A dyad containing green light-
absorbing rhodamine as an energy donor and a chlorophyll a
derivative as an energy acceptor has been reported, and an
eﬃcient energy transfer from rhodamine to chlorin moiety has
been determined.9 We anticipated that positively charged
rhodamine might be an eﬃcient electron acceptor
for a
photoexcited chlorin, and thus might signiﬁcantly quench the
chlorin ﬂuorescence in resulting arrays constructs (as it was
reported for analogous porphyrin−rhodamine arrays).23,24 There-
fore, as an auxiliary chromophore, we have chosen a boron
complex of dipyrrin (often referred to as BODIPY).25−28
BODIPY is a class of neutral molecules, broadly utilized as
ﬂuorescent labels and probes, with molar excitation coeﬃcients up
to 100 000 M−1·cm−1, and usually possessing high ﬂuorescence
quantum yields. There are numerous examples of energy transfer
dyads where BODIPY derivatives have been employed as energy
donor,25,26 including these with red or near-IR emitting
acceptors,27 and a wide range of BODIPY−porphyrin dyads.28
To the best of our knowledge, the only examples of BODIPY−
hydroporphyrin arrays are the aza-BODIPY−chlorin dyads
reported by Tamiaki, where a chlorophyll-type moiety functions
as an energy donor, and aza-BODIPY as an energy acceptor.22
In this paper, we describe the synthesis and evaluation of
optical properties of BODIPY−chlorin arrays. Our goal was to
establish a molecular architecture for arrays which assures
bright emission of the chlorin acceptor upon excitation of the
BODIPY donor, regardless of polarity of environment. This
requires eﬃcient energy transfer, and a lack of competitive
processes, which might quench ﬂuorescence of chlorin. The
latter processes can be potentially devastating for the emission
properties of dyads, as signiﬁcant quenching of ﬂuorescence of
both donor and acceptor has been reported (for example, in
BODIPY−phthalocyanine dyads29). One such process could be
photoinduced electron transfer (PET),
from photoexcited
chlorin to BODIPY. Chlorins are known as a potent electron
donor in their excited state,18,30 and quenching of BODIPY
ﬂuorescence by PET is a well-known phenomenon.31 Indeed,
signiﬁcant quenching of ﬂuorescence in aza-BODIPY−chlorin
dyads in polar solvents due to PET has been reported.22
Additionally, we have been searching for the BODIPY−
chlorin dyad architecture which would provide versatility in
tuning the absorption/emission wavelengths of chlorin. The
wavelength of absorption and emission can be tuned by a

substitution of chlorins at the 3- and 13-positions;3,4 therefore,
our construct should allow placing diﬀerent substituents at
these positions.

Toward these goals, we designed two types of arrays (Chart 1).
In the ﬁrst type [arrays 1-BDP, 2-(BDP)2, and Zn2-(BDP)2], a
BODIPY unit is attached at the 13- and 3,13-positions, through a
phenylethynyl linker. In these constructs, the linker functions also
as an auxochrome which tunes emission properties of chlorin. In
the second type (dyads 3-BDP, 4-BDP, and Zn4-BDP), a
BODIPY unit is attached to a phenyl group localized at the
10-position of chlorin through an amide bond, while
auxochromes (phenylethynyl groups) are placed independently
at the 3- and 13-positions. Two corresponding Zn(II) chelates
of some arrays were prepared [i.e., Zn2-(BDP)2 and Zn4-
BDP] to evaluate the inﬂuence of metal complexation of
chlorin on optical properties of resulting arrays. This selection
of arrays enables us to examine properties of architectures for
which the chlorin acceptor possesses a broad range of optical
and redox properties, since both substitution at
the 3,13-
positions and zinc metalation markedly alter absorption/
emission maxima, and redox properties of chlorins.3,4,18 As
benchmark donors, we investigated corresponding BODIPY
derivatives, BDP-TMS and BDP-NHBz, and as benchmark
acceptors, chlorin derivatives, 1−3 and Zn2 (Chart 1).
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
<para sub="scope">
Synthesis. Syntheses of

target BODIPY−chlorin arrays
required two diﬀerent strategies. The key reaction for the
synthesis of 1-BDP and 2-(BDP)2 is Sonogashira coupling of
bromosubstituted chlorins with a BODIPY derivative with a
4-ethynylphenyl substituent at the meso position (BDP-H). For
the synthesis of 3-BDP and 4-BDP, we employed amide bond
formation between chlorin derivatives possessing a carboxylic
acid function and amine-functionalized BODIPY (BDP-NH2).
Both strategies utilize similar chlorin building blocks: chlorins
1-Br, 2-Br2, and 3, each possessing a 4-(methoxycarbonyl)-
phenyl substituent at the 10-position. The synthesis of 13-
bromochlorin 1-Br has been previously reported.20 Chlorins
2-Br2 and 3 were synthesized using reported procedures for
analogous derivatives (Scheme 1).32,33 Thus, bromination of
known formyldipyrromethane 520 with 1 or 2 equivs of NBS
provides 1-bromo-9-formyldipyrromethane 6-Br (94% yield) or
1,2-dibromo-9-formyldipyrromethane 6-Br2 (67% yield), re-
spectively. Subsequent condensation of 6-Br with tetrahydro-
dipyrrin 7, and 6-Br2 with 8-bromotetrahydrodipyrrin 7-Br,
followed by zinc-mediated oxidative cyclization, and demetala-
tion provides 3 (25% yield), and 2-Br2 (17% yield).

Characterization. Target arrays were characterized by 1H,

2-(BDP)2 shows a low solubility in common organic solvents,
which prevents recording of a good quality 13C NMR and 19F
NMR spectra. The NMR spectra for all arrays are consistent
with expected structures. In particular, 1H NMR spectra for
dyads 1-BDP, 3-BDP, and 4-BDP show resonances of protons
from both the chlorin macrocycle and the BODIPY unit, with
integration indicating a 1-to-1 ratio of chlorin to BODIPY. The

slightly nonequivalent BODIPY units.

problematic. We were able to obtain the 1H NMR spectrum
only for a crude sample of Zn2-(BDP)2. After chromatographic
puriﬁcation and washing with MeOH and hexanes, the sample
became insoluble, and no 1H NMR spectra could be recorded.
Nevertheless, the 1H NMR spectrum of crude Zn2-(BDP)2

Absorption spectra for arrays are essentially the sum of
absorption spectra of their components (Figure 1, Table 1). For
dyads 3-BDP, 4-BDP, and Zn4-BDP, the absorption maxima
are identical to those for corresponding benchmark monomers
3, 2, and Zn2, respectively, while, for 1-BDP, 2-(BDP)2, and
Zn2-(BDP)2, absorption bands for chlorin components are
slightly shifted bathochromically by 1−7 nm compared to those
for monomers 1, 2, and Zn2, respectively.
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Emission spectra of chlorin benchmarks contain a narrow
band, with relatively small Stokes shifts (1−6 nm). BDP-TMS
and BDP-NHBz show a strong emission band at 517 and
516 nm, respectively. Emission spectra of all BODIPY−chlorin
arrays are dominated by emission of the chlorin component.
The maxima of chlorin emission in dyads 1-BDP, 2-(BDP)2,
and Zn2-(BDP)2 are shifted bathochromically by 2−5 nm,
compared to those for benchmark monomers, while emission
maxima for 3-BDP, 4-BDP, and Zn4-BDP appear exactly at the
same wavelengths as for corresponding monomers. For each
array, signiﬁcant quenching of BODIPY ﬂuorescence and almost
exclusive emission from chlorin components are observed, even
when BODIPY is directly excited at the wavelength where
chlorins show a negligible absorbance (Figure 2). Excitation
spectra, monitored at the wavelengths where chlorin com-
ponents emit exclusively (not shown) closely resemble the
corresponding absorption spectra. These indicate an eﬃcient
excitation energy transfer
from BODIPY to the chlorin
chromophore.
</para>

In order to quantitatively assess the energy transfer eﬃciency
and presence of putative quenching processes in dyads, we
determined the quantum yields of ﬂuorescence of chlorin
components for dyads and benchmark monomers in toluene
and DMF (Table 1). We determined the relevant quantum
yields in polar solvent to evaluate the possible quenching of
chlorin ﬂuorescence via PET, which is facilitated in polar solvents.
<para sub=“props”>
The ﬂuorescence quantum yields in toluene for chlorin
monomers increases with the number of conjugated sub-
stituents at the 3,13-positions: 0.21 for 3 (no substituents),
0.33 for 1 (one substituent), and 0.37 for 2 (two substituents).
Quantum yield of emission for Zn2 in toluene is 0.33. These
data are consistent with those reported for analogous chlorin
derivatives.3,16 Quantum yields of ﬂuorescence for monomers
only slightly depend on solvent polarity, and values are nearly
identical in DMF as in toluene (Table 1). Only for Zn2, we
observed an increase in DMF (1.12-fold vs toluene). This
increase we attributed to coordination of DMF to zinc, since
such coordination has been reported to increase the ﬂuo-
rescence quantum yields for porphyrins.37
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
Quantum yields of ﬂuorescence of chlorin components in
dyads were determined by direct excitation of a given chlorin at
the maxima of the B bands (410−430 nm), where the BODIPY
component has a negligible absorbance. In nonpolar solvent
(toluene), quantum yields for dyads are comparable (3-BDP
and 4-BDP), or even slightly higher (1-BDP and 2-BDP) than
those for the corresponding benchmark monomers (Table 1).
This indicates that,
in nonpolar solvents, the presence of a
BODIPY unit does not quench the emission from chlorin.

In highly polar DMF, ﬂuorescence of 1-BDP is 0.71-fold of
that in toluene, while, for 2-BDP, it is 0.93-fold. Fluorescence

same as those in toluene.

the contrary, ﬂuorescence quantum yields for Zn4-BDP in both

<para sub=“props”>
The eﬃciency of energy transfer (ETE)38 for BODIPY−
chlorin arrays has been determined by comparison of ﬂuo-
rescence quantum yields of the chlorin acceptor upon excitation
at
the donor absorption maxima (504 nm, where chlorin
absorbs much less than BODIPY), with ﬂuorescence quantum
yield obtained upon direct chlorin excitation at the maximum of
the B band (Table 1). The ETE is relatively high (>0.90) in
toluene and is rather independent of solvent polarity for 1-BDP
and 2-(BDP)2. For amide-linked 3-BDP and 4-BDP, ETE in
DMF is slightly lower than that in toluene; however, it still
exceeds 0.85. ETE for Zn4-BDP (0.87 and 0.80 in toluene and
DMF, respectively) is noticeably lower than that
for the
corresponding free base;
this also appears to be true for
Zn2-(BDP)2 (0.87 in toluene; ETE for Zn2-BDP in DMF
cannot be determined accurately, due to the low ﬂuorescence
intensity for excitations at both BODIPY and B bands maxima).
</para>
<para sub=“props”>
The eﬃcient energy transfer between BODIPY and chlorin is
likely driven by the overlap of the BODIPY emission band with
the Qx band of chlorin. The lower ETE for dyads containing
chlorin zinc complexes can be explained by the lower oscillator
strength of the Qx band for zinc chlorin complexes, compared
with free bases,4,11 which results in lower spectral overlap.
Despite the high and comparable ETE, both classes of arrays
reported here exhibit a diﬀerent behavior in polar solvent. The
ﬂuorescence quantum yields for amide-linked dyads are nearly
the same in toluene and DMF. However, for arrays where
BODIPY is attached through a phenylacetylene linker at the
3- and 3,13-positions, quantum yields depend on the solvent,
and ﬂuorescence is diminished in DMF, compared to toluene.
While reduction of ﬂuorescence in the case of 2-(BDP)2
(0.93-fold in DMF, compared to toluene) is comparable with
these observed for amide-linker dyads, a more pronounced
reduction in intensity is observed for 1-BDP, (0.71-fold
intensity in DMF of that in toluene), and almost complete
quenching (∼30 times) for Zn2-(BDP)2. The observed
reduction of ﬂuorescence in polar DMF is most likely due to
photoinduced electron transfer (PET) from excited chlorin to
BODIPY. Such PET would be more favorable in polar solvents,
due to the stabilization of the resulting ion-radical pair. The
much more extensive quenching of ﬂuorescence observed for
Zn2-(BDP)2 can be explained by the lower oxidation potential
for zinc complexes of chlorins, compared to the corresponding
free bases;18 hence, the chlorin moiety in Zn2-(BDP)2 is likely
more prone to oxidation than in 2-(BDP)2. Similarly, it has
been reported that installation of (phenyl)ethynyl substituents
at the 3,13-positions of chlorin leads to the increase of the
oxidation potential of chlorin;4,18 thus, this explains the lower
ﬂuorescence for 1-BDP vs 2-(BDP)2 in DMF.

The important observation is that ﬂuorescence quantum
yields for amide-linked dyads are nearly identical in DMF and
toluene. Particularly striking is the diﬀerence between Zn2-
(BDP)2 and Zn4-BDP, where chlorin macrocycles should
possess comparable redox properties. The nearly complete
quenching of ﬂuorescence for Zn2-(BDP)2 in DMF and no
quenching for Zn4-BDP indicate that
linker
connecting the chlorin and BODIPY and perhaps the position
of BODIPY attachment play a critical role in photochemical
properties of resulting arrays. A possible reason for the ob-
served diﬀerences might be the stronger electronic coupling
between chlorin and BODIPY in phenylethynyl-linked dyads

is known that
phenylethynyl-type linkers provide strong electronic coupling
between dyads’ components and promote ultrafast PET.39
Electronic communication between BODIPY and chlorin can
be inferred from absorption and emission spectra of 1-BDP and
(Zn)2-(BDP)2, which show slight bathochromic shift of both
Qy absorption and emission bands, and increased ﬂuorescence
quantum yields (in toluene) of chlorin components, compared
to the benchmark monomers (see Table 1). For 3-BDP and
4-BDP, both absorption and emission maxima and ﬂuorescence
quantum yields are identical to those for the corresponding
benchmark monomers, which suggests that there is a negligible
conjugation between chlorin and BODIPY, which, in turn, may
lead to an attenuation of photoinduced electron transfer.
However, further systematic time-resolved spectroscopic and
electrochemical measurements are necessary to elucidate the
exact mechanism of quenching of ﬂuorescence for chlorin
components in arrays.

In order to further evaluate the applicability of amide-linked
BODIPY−chlorin dyads for bioimaging, we compared the
quantum yields of ﬂuorescence for the chlorin component in
arrays upon excitation at
the BODIPY
absorption, in various solvents (toluene, MeOH, DMSO, DMF;
Table S1, Supporting Information). The data show that the
dyads 3-BDP, 4-BDP, and Zn4-BDP retain relatively high
ﬂuorescence quantum yields in solvents of diﬀerent polarities.
Fluorescence for these arrays is comparable in toluene, DMF, and
DMSO, and modestly reduced in MeOH (on average ﬂuorescence
quantum yields in MeOH are 0.71-fold of that in toluene). Finally,
we compared the ﬂuorescence intensity for dyads vs monomers
upon excitation at ∼500 nm, at the same concentration. We ob-
served 5.2-fold and 4.7-fold increases for 3-BDP and 5.5-fold and
5.2-fold for 4-BDP in toluene and DMF, respectively.

■ CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
We identiﬁed the molecular architecture for BODIPY−chlorin
arrays with bright ﬂuorescence of chlorin upon excitation
at ∼500 nm in various solvents of diﬀerent polarities. While all
examined arrays exhibit an eﬃcient energy transfer
from
BODIPY to the chlorin moiety, the dyads where BODIPY is
attached at 13- or 3,13-positions of chlorin exhibit diminished
ﬂuorescence in polar solvent, compared to that observed in
toluene. The reduction of ﬂuorescence is the most pronounced
in the case of the array comprising a Zn(II) complex of chlorin.
On the contrary, dyads where BODIPY is attached through an
amide bond at the 10-position of chlorin exhibit a relatively
high ﬂuorescence quantum yield in various solvents of diﬀerent
polarities, for all three dyads examined. Therefore, the con-
struct, represented by dyads 3-BDP and (Zn)4-BDP, constitutes
an attractive platform for development of deep-red or near-IR
ﬂuorophores excitable with green (and near-IR) light. In that
architecture, the wavelength of chlorin emission can be tuned by
placing diﬀerent substituents at 3,13-positions of chlorin, or by
insertion of Zn(II) into the chlorin macrocycle. Obviously,
application of reported dyads in ﬂuorescence imaging requires
modiﬁcation of
their structure to provide water solubility,
installation of bioconjugatable groups, etc. These are the subjects
of ongoing research in our laboratory.

■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION

General Experimental Section. 1H NMR (400 MHz), 13C NMR
(100 MHz), and 19F NMR (376 MHz) spectra were collected at room

temperature in CDCl3, unless noted otherwise. Chemical shifts (δ)
were callibrated using solvent peaks (1H signals: residual proton
signals: 7.26 ppm for chloroform, 2.50 ppm for DMSO; 13C signals:
77.0 ppm for CDCl3, 39.5 ppm for DMSO-d6). All solvents and com-
mercially available reagents were used as received. Palladium coupling
reactions was performed using commercially available anhydrous
solvents (toluene and DMF). Low-resolution LD-MS analyses were
performed without matrix. The FT-ICR analyzer was used for ESI and
MALDI HRMS.

Known compounds 1-Br,20 5,20 7,40 BDP-NH2,36 and 7-Br41 were
prepared following reported procedures. Known compound 6-Br2,20
BDP-TMS,34 and BDP-H,34 were prepared by modiﬁed procedure.

reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at −78 °C. The cooling bath was
removed, the reaction mixture was warmed up to −20 °C, and a
hexanes/water mixture (∼10 mL, 1:1) was added. The organic layer
was separated, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated. Column chroma-
tography (silica [hexanes/dichloromethane/ethyl acetate, 7:3:2])

ethyl acetate (20 mL), and the organic layer was then washed with
water and brine, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated. Column
chromatography [silica, hexane/CH2Cl2 (1:2)] yielded a mixture of
product and a green-ﬂuorescent impurity. The resulting sample was
dissolved in CH2Cl2, mixed with silica (∼2g), and concentrated. The
resulting powder was loaded on the top of a silica column and eluted
with MeOH (the green-ﬂuorescent impurity was eluted, whereas
insoluble 4-BDP stayed on the top of the column). Elution with
MeOH was continued until
impurity was
completely eluted. The 4-BDP was then eluted with CH2Cl2. The
resulting sample was washed with MeOH and hexanes to aﬀord a
