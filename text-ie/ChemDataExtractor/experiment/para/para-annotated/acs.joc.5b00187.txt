ABSTRACT: Dithianes are versatile umpolung intermediates
in organic synthesis but have rarely been employed in radical
cross-coupling reactions. Here we describe the oxidative
coupling method for alkyne difunctionalization under metal-
catalyst-free conditions. The eﬃcient protocol directly aﬀords
a variety of β-ketodithianes in good to excellent yields with
high regioselectivities. It provides a general pathway for accessing valuable dithianes with controlled formation of a new C−C
bond and a C−O bond via a radical coupling pathway.

R adical addition of unactivated alkynes is believed to be the

most convenient procedure to generate reactive vinyl
radicals, which could be trapped via subsequent transformation
and thus appear in many diverse applications in organic
chemistry.1 Among various strategies for alkyne difunctionaliza-
tion, radical oxidative coupling (ROC)2 reactions have played
important
roles in synthetic organic chemistry for bond
formations, and those processes can oﬀer many complementary
methods to eﬃciently increase molecular complexity (Scheme
1). Recently, several remarkable advances of ROC catalyzed by
nonprecious metals (Fe, Cu, Ni) and metal-catalyst-free mild
conditions for bond construction in the presence of a green
oxidant such as oxygen have been developed.3−7 In particular,
Lei and co-workers elegantly reported a pioneering metal-
catalyst-free aerobic oxysulfonylation of terminal alkynes (eq

1).5 More recently, Lipshutz6 and Loh7
independently
developed this ROC of aryl alkynes using a hydrocarbon
nanomicelle (eq 2) and DMSO (eq 3) in a number of C−S
bond-forming transformations. Despite the remarkable exten-
sions and developments of alkyne difunctionalization,
the
discovery of new atom-economical protocols toward advanced
intermediates is still highly worthwhile.

Dithiane compounds serve as valuable synthetic intermedi-
ates (umpolung synthons) in the ﬁeld of natural product
synthesis and can participate in a range of useful
trans-
formations.8 However, dithiane anion chemistry applied in
various synthetic sequences requires either lithiation or the use
of anhydrous and anaerobic technology.8a,b Access to β-
ketodithianes by radical cross-coupling would have advantages
over traditional dithiane anion strategies, and the ability to form
dithiane derivatives directly would improve the eﬃciency of
synthetic routes. In this regard, our group has a long-standing
interest
in the novel and versatile protocols to construct
dithiane derivatives.9 Recently, our group introduced the ﬁrst
protocol for the direct cross-coupling of alkene involving a
novel dithianyl radical coupling mechanism.9a,c On this basis,
we postulated that an oxidative dithiane radical strategy10 could
serve as a platform for the difunctionalization of unactivated
alkynes (Scheme 1, eq 4). Mechanistically, we expected that
radical addition of alkyne with the dithianyl radical should give
the dithiane vinyl
intermediate, where subsequent
interaction with molecular oxygen would be highly favored
and ultimately lead to β-ketodithiane, which is known to be a
key intermediate for useful transformations.11 To the best of
our knowledge, the alkyne difunctionalization with a dithianyl
radical for tandem C−C and C−O bond formations has not yet
been reported. In this paper, we report our recent progress on
for alkyne

However, these results indicated that the process involving the
C−C coupling and the subsequent transformation was indeed
possible (Table 1, entries 1−6). A number of commercially
available protic acids was examined. To our delight, further
optimization showed that the combination of a stoichiometric
amount of methanesulfonic acid (MsOH) at 50 °C under an
atmosphere of air5−7,13 served as the best condition, providing a
good yield of β-ketodithiane product 3a (Table 1, entry 7). It is
important to note that when the reactions were employed by

unsuccessful and trace amounts of product 3a were obtained.

With optimized reaction conditions established (Table 1,
entry 7), we next turned our attention to a variety of aryl and
aliphatic alkynes that can participate in this novel process. As
shown in Table 2, the standard reaction system using 1.2 equiv

terminal aryl alkynes, aﬀording the desired β-ketodithiane

and para (1b−1g) substituents provided good yields of coupled

Furthermore, the internal alkynes ranging from aryl to aliphatic
substituents (1o, 1p, 1r−1t) could also be eﬀectively coupled in

slightly. For example, using 2 equiv of MsOH in DCE for 12−

Information. Flash chromatography columns were
generally performed on silica gel (200−300 mesh) in petroleum (bp
60−90 °C), and reactions were monitored by thin layer chromatog-
raphy (TLC) using silica gel GF254 plates with UV light to visualize
the course of the reaction. All new compounds were characterized by
1H NMR, 13C NMR, IR, MS, and HRMS. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were run with tetramethylsilane as an internal standard at 300 and 75
MHz, respectively. All chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts per
million and coupling constants (J) in hertz. IR spectra were obtained
with neat thin ﬁlms on a sodium chloride disk and were recorded on
an Fourier transform infrared spectrometer.

General Procedure for the Alkyne Difunctionalization. To a
ﬂame-dried 10 mL ﬂask were added 2-chloro-1,3-dithiane 2 (34 mg,
0.25 mmol), 1a−1t (0.225 mmol), and methanesulfonic acid (1.2−2.0
equiv) in 2 mL of DCE. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for
4−24 h and then cooled to rt. The reaction solution was diluted with
ethyl acetate (5 mL) and saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (5 mL). The
organic layer was separated, and the aqueous phase was re-extracted
with ethyl acetate (3 × 3 mL). The combined organic extracts were
washed with brine (10 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The
solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure and puriﬁed by
column chromatography on silica gel with petroleum/ethyl acetate
(EA/PE = 1:50) to yield products 3a−3t.

Radical-Trapping Experiments. To a ﬂame-dried 10 mL ﬂask
were added 2-chloro-1,3-dithiane 2 (34 mg, 0.25 mmol), 1a (25 mg,
0.25 mmol), methanesulfonic acid (25 mg, 0.25 mmol), and TEMPO
(150 mg, 0.75 mmol) or BHT (165 mg, 0.75 mmol) in 2 mL of DCE.
The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 24 h. The reaction
mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (10 mL) and H2O (5 mL). The
organic layer was separated, and the aqueous phase was re-extracted
with ethyl acetate (3 × 3 mL). The combined organic extracts were
washed with H2O (10 mL) and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4.

acid and DCE in this experiment had been dried), then 2-chloro-1,3-
dithiane 2 (34 mg, 0.25 mmol) and 1a (25 mg, 0.25 mmol) were
added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C for 6 h. The reaction

On the basis of previous works in our group,9 we anticipated
that the dithianyl radical was generated via the homolysis of 2-
chlorodithiane under air and heating. The generated dithianyl
radical would be highly nucleophilic and thereby readily
facilitate conjugate addition with alkyne to forge a new C−C
bond with concomitant
radical
intermediate (II). Subsequently, the generated vinyl radical
species are further oxidized by air to give a peroxyl radical (III),
which may stabilize to a hydroperoxide intermediate (IV) by
hydrogen abstraction from DCE.17 The hydroperoxide could
intermediate (V), thus
undergo heterolysis to generate enol
completing the ROC reaction to form the desired β-
ketodithiane. It was worthy to note that one possible diﬃculty
may be the issue of C−O versus C−Cl bond formation;
however, the appropriate choice of acid can block the C−Cl
bond formation toward the desired β-keto product (Scheme 3).

In summary, we have described the direct alkyne
the eﬃcient construction of β-
difunctionalization for
ketodithianes. We have demonstrated that the versatile method
tolerates broad substrate scope and good functional group
compatibility. More importantly, this novel process provides an
alternative to generate highly substituted dithiane derivatives
