How to count:

chemical entities labeled with <cem> and </cem>

1) do nothing to ones that are correctly labeled
2) incorrectly labeled replace tag with <incorrect> </incorrect>
   - includes when entity is not a chemical but a name/compound number etc...
3) incorrect but still a chemical <inc_new> and </inc_new>
   - chemicals that are tagged but too inclusive (ie have more than one chemical name wrapped in <cem>)
   - includes when two chemicals are not tagged together but is one compound.
 
4) Chemicals not recognized by the extractor but manually use <newcem> and </newcem>
   - many times they are abbreviations


How calculations were performed:
1) there are 2 files. 1 that is annotated and one that is the reference that has nothing changed. This will allow us to get the reference number of compounds that were extracted by the program.
2) open all files in python, concatenate the texts into text and text_reference, count the instances:

	if paragraphs in text == reference: (to help ensure they are from the same manuscripts and there are not extra paragraphs in the reference text that have chemical annotations which will mess up the calculation)
		a) #paragarphs = count('<para')
		b) #Total extracted entites that are correct = count('<cem>')
		c) #Total extracted entites = reference text count('<cem>')
		d) # total correct entites = count('<cem>') + count('<newcem>') + count('<inc_new>') 

		precision = #extracted entites which are correct / #extracted entities
		recall = #extracted entites which are correct / #correct entities
		F1 = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall)




### personal notes that may not make sense###

Generally, the missed chemical entities are abbreviations and will miss the same one multiple times in a manuscript. 

Ha Hb describing hydrogens? it does not find the carbons like C5 so i am changing them to incorrect

aryl? yes no or does it need to contain the whole description? aryl-substituted

general descriptors like ligand? - yes

does not get continuations such as: quin-
oline

Lewis acidic character - no but - Lewis acidic salts -yes
<chem>hydrogen</cem> bond - not a chemical (198 has ~three instances)

Hard example: because it should be SnCl2•H20:
•2H2O/<cem>MeOH</cem> indicated the initial formation
spectra of <cem>SnCl2
